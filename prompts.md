"content": "Do this for this abstract: It has been demonstrated that individuals exposed to actual or simulated microgravity often experience cardiovascular dysfunctions when returning to Earth. The underlying mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance and countermeasure treatment are still poorly understood. In this paper, the progress in the mechanism of cardiovascular deconditioning from the view of vascular remodeling, increased venous compliance in the lower limbs, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and cell signaling pathway was reviewed. Meanwhile, an overview of the countermeasures including exercise, lower body negative pressure, thigh cuffs, traditional Chinese herb medicine and artificial gravity was presented."

You are assisting in screening articles for a scoping review on immunological considerations in medical screening for Commercial Spaceflight (CSF). Your task is to determine how to categorize each article based on the provided criteria. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the evidence, map key concepts, and inform future research in the emerging field of immunology in CSF.
Research Question:
What are the known, suspected, or potential immunological issues and associated risks for commercial spaceflight participants?
Secondary Research Questions:
What are the impacts of spaceflight-related conditions (e.g., radiation, microgravity, isolation) on the immune system?
How do physiological and psychological stressors during spaceflight affect immune function?
What mitigation strategies or countermeasures have been proposed or implemented to address immunological risks in spaceflight?
How does the duration of spaceflight (brief, short, medium, long) influence immunological responses and potential health outcomes?
What gaps exist in the current literature regarding immunological health in commercial spaceflight participants?
Key Inclusion Criteria:
Timeframe: 2000-2023 (present)
Setting: Spaceflight experience/profile and/or analogues/simulation
• Profiles: suborbital, orbital, lunar, planetary, trans-atmospheric
• Analogues: parabolic, centrifuge, bed rest, dry immersion, head-down tilt, etc.
Duration: Consider physiological and psychological adaptations associated with duration
Human medical conditions related to CSF, focusing on immunological aspects
Language: Full text available in English
Sample: Adult human participants (18 years and older), with focus on commercial spaceflight participants
Peer-reviewed articles relevant to Commercial Spaceflight and immunology
Key Exclusion Criteria:
Animal, in-silico, or in-vitro studies
Pediatrics or age less than 18 years
Full text not available in English after exhaustive searching
Gray literature: dissertations, theses, technical reports, proprietary information
Editorials, magazine articles, or web-based/digital media
Textbooks
Immunology Focus:
Pay special attention to topics related to immunology, microbiology, inflammation, infection risk, and immune system response. Consider the provided keyword list for relevant terms.
Please review the following article information:
Title: <article_title>{{Title}}</article_title>
Year: <article_year>{{Published_Year}}</article_year>
Abstract: <article_abstract>{{Abstract}}</article_abstract>
Based on this information, categorize the article into one of the following decisions:
Exclude and do not review
Exclude, but review for discussion (relevant to spaceflight but does not meet inclusion criteria)
Maybe, unclear whether to include but perform full text review
Include
Provide a brief justification for your decision, explaining how the article meets or fails to meet the criteria. Then, state your decision.
Format your response as follows:
<justification> [Your justification here. Include specific references to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and how the article aligns with or deviates from them. Discuss its relevance to immunology in commercial spaceflight. If marking as "maybe," explain what additional information would be needed to make a definitive decision.] </justification> <decision>[1. Exclude and do not review / 2. Exclude, review for discussion / 3. Maybe, perform full text review / 4. Include]</decision>
<tags>[List relevant tags from the provided keyword list]</tags>
If you mark an article as "maybe," suggest what additional information or clarification would be needed to make a definitive decision.
Remember to consider the specific aims of the review:
Identify known or suspected reported immunological issues and risks for commercial spaceflight
Find literature which supports these findings
Assess the literature
Your assessment should help inform primary care medical personnel advising clients on medical considerations from an immunology perspective for commercial spaceflight.

You are assisting in screening articles for a scoping review on immunological considerations in Commercial Spaceflight (CSF). Your task is to classify each article into one of three categories, considering both the article's relevance and quality.Classification Categories:1. Include

* Directly relevant to immunology in commercial spaceflight
* Meets all inclusion criteria
* High-quality evidence that addresses research questions
* Requires full-text review

2. Exclude but Review for Discussion

* Related to spaceflight immunology but doesn't fully meet inclusion criteria
* May focus on professional astronauts but has relevant implications for CSF
* Contains valuable background information
* Should be referenced in discussion section

3. Exclude and Don't Review

* Completely irrelevant to topic
* Fails multiple inclusion criteria
* Poor quality or inappropriate study design
* No value for background or discussion

Research Focus:
Primary Question: What are the known, suspected, or potential immunological issues and associated risks for commercial spaceflight participants?Key Immunological Domains:1. Basic Immunology Concepts

* Cellular components (B cells, T cells, etc.)
* Molecular factors (cytokines, antibodies, etc.)
* Immune system regulation

* Viral infections (HSV, EBV, COVID-19, etc.)
* Autoimmune conditions
* Immunodeficiency states
* Inflammatory responses

3. Infectious Disease/Microbiology

* Bacterial infections
* Fungal infections
* Antimicrobial resistance
* Transmission risks

4. Oncology Considerations

* Cancer risks
* Genomic instability
* Tumor development
* Metastatic potential
