MicroRNA-18a-5p mitigates oxygen-glucose-deprivation/reoxygenation-induced injury through suppression of TLRs/NF-κB signaling by targeting TLR8 in PC12 cells,"Lu, Ying-Yun; Ma, Xiao-Jun; Yang, Yan-Na","This work aimed to assess the role of TLR8 in cerebral I/R injury and its in-depth pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that TLR8 was up-regulated in patients with ischemic stroke than that in healthy control, and miR-18a-5p was the upstream regulatory of TLR8. Then, the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were exposed in oxygen-glucose-deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) conditions to construct a modelin vitro. The functional experiments indicated that OGD/R can decline the viability and elevate the apoptosis of PC12 cells, while up-regulation of miR-18a-5p can alleviate OGD/R-induced cell injury. Notably, overexpression of TLR8 reverses the miR-18a-5p-mediated protection on OGD/R-induced cells injury. Finally, we found that up-regulation of miR-18a-5p obviously declined the protein levels of TLR4 and TLR7 as well as the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B, while overexpression of TLR8 canceled the decrease caused by miR-18a-5p up-regulation. In summing, our results illustrated that miR-18a-5p/TLR8 axis can mitigate OGD/R-induced cells injury through TLRs and NF-kappa B pathway.",2020,,BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,84,12,2476-2483,WOS:000561133900001,10.1080/09168451.2020.1806705,,#10926,Lu 2020,,
Auditory detection probability of propeller noise in hover flight in presence of ambient soundscape,"Stalnov, Oksana; Faran, Michael; Koral, Yonatan; Furst, Miriam","Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly advancing and becoming ubiquitous in an unlimited number of applications, from parcel delivery to people transportation. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) markets expand, the increased acoustic nuisance on population becomes a more acute problem. Previous aircraft noise assessments have highlighted the necessity of a psychoacoustic metric for quantification of human audio perception. This study presents a framework for estimating propeller-based UAV auditory detection probability on the ground for a listener in a real-life scenario. The detection probability is derived by using its free-field measured acoustic background and estimating the UAV threshold according to a physiological model of the auditory pathway. The method is presented via results of an exemplar measurement in an anechoic environment with a single two- and five-bladed propeller. It was found that the auditory detection probability is primarily affected by the background noise level, whereas the number of blades is a less significant parameter. The significance of the proposed method lies in providing a quantitative evaluation of auditory detection probability of the UAV on the ground in the presence of a given soundscape. The results of this work are of practical significance since the method can aid anyone who plans a hovering flight mode.

Signs of Muller cell gliotic response found in the retina of newts exposed to real and simulated microgravity,"Grigoryan, E. N.; Anton, H. J.; Poplinskaya, V. A.; Aleinikova, K. S.; Domaratskaya, E. I.; Novikova, Y. P.; Almeida, E.","The effects of real and simulated microgravity on the eye tissue regeneration of newts were investigated. For the first time changes in Muller glial cells in the retina of eyes regenerating after retinal detachment were detected in newts exposed to clinorotation. The cells divided, were hypertrophied, and their processes were thickened. Such changes suggested reactive gliosis and were more significant in animals exposed to rotation when compared with desk-top controls. Later experiments onboard the Russian biosatellite Bion-11 showed similar changes in the retinas that were regenerating in a two-week spaceflight. In the Bion-11 animals, GFAP, the major structural protein of retinal macroglial cells, was found to be upregulated. In a more recent experiment onboard Foton-M3 (2007), GFAP expression in retinas of space-flown, ground control (kept at 1 g), and basal control (sacrificed on launch day) newts was quantified, using microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and digital image analysis. A low level of immunoreactivity was observed in basal controls. In contrast, retinas of space-flown animals showed greater GFAP immunoreactivity associated with both an increased cell number and a higher thickness of intermediate filaments. This, in turn, was accompanied by up-regulation of stress protein (HSP90) and growth factor (FGF2) expressions. It can be postulated that such a response of Muller cells was to mitigate the retinal stress in newts exposed to microgravity. Taken together, the data suggest that the retinal population of macroglial cells could be sensitive to gravity changes and that in space it can react by enhancing its neuroprotective function.

Survival of endospores of Bacillus subtilis on spacecraft surfaces under simulated martian environments: implications for the forward contamination of Mars.,"Schuerger, Andrew C; Mancinelli, Rocco L; Kern, Roger G; Rothschild, Lynn J; McKay, Christopher P","Experiments were conducted in a Mars simulation chamber (MSC) to characterize the survival of endospores of Bacillus subtilis under high UV irradiation and simulated martian conditions. The MSC was used to create Mars surface environments in which pressure (8.5 mb), temperature (-80, -40, -10, or +23 degrees C), gas composition (Earth-normal N2/O2 mix, pure N2, pure CO2, or a Mars gas mix), and UV-VIS-NIR fluence rates (200-1200 nm) were maintained within tight limits. The Mars gas mix was composed of CO2 (95.3%), N2 (2.7%), Ar (1.7%), O2 (0.2%), and water vapor (0.03%). Experiments were conducted to measure the effects of pressure, gas composition, and temperature alone or in combination with Mars-normal UV-VIS-NIR light environments. Endospores of B. subtilis, were deposited on aluminum coupons as monolayers in which the average density applied to coupons was 2.47 x 10(6) bacteria per sample. Populations of B. subtilis placed on aluminum coupons and subjected to an Earth-normal temperature (23 degrees C), pressure (1013 mb), and gas mix (normal N2/O2 ratio) but illuminated with a Mars-normal UV-VIS-NIR spectrum were reduced by over 99.9% after 30 sec exposure to Mars-normal UV fluence rates. However, it required at least 15 min of Mars-normal UV exposure to reduce bacterial populations on aluminum coupons to non-recoverable levels. These results were duplicated when bacteria were exposed to Mars-normal environments of temperature (-10 degrees C), pressure (8.5 mb), gas composition (pure CO2), and UV fluence rates. In other experiments, results indicated that the gas composition of the atmosphere and the temperature of the bacterial monolayers at the time of Mars UV exposure had no effects on the survival of bacterial endospores. But Mars-normal pressures (8.5 mb) were found to reduce survival by approximately 20-35% compared to Earth-normal pressures (1013 mb). The primary implications of these results are (a) that greater than 99.9% of bacterial populations on sun-exposed surfaces of spacecraft are likely to be inactivated within a few tens of seconds to a few minutes on the surface of Mars, and (b) that within a single Mars day under clear-sky conditions bacterial populations on sun-exposed surfaces of spacecraft will be sterilized. Furthermore, these results suggest that the high UV fluence rates on the martian surface can be an important resource in minimizing the forward contamination of Mars. Copyright c2003 Elsevier Inc.

Human Performance of Novice Schedulers for Complex Spaceflight Operations Timelines.,"Marquez, Jessica J; Edwards, Tamsyn; Karasinski, John A; Lee, Candice N; Shyr, Megan C; Miller, Casey L; Brandt, Summer L","OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effects of scheduling task complexity on human performance for novice schedulers creating spaceflight timelines., BACKGROUND: Future astronauts will be expected to self-schedule, yet will not be experts in creating timelines that meet the complex constraints inherent to spaceflight operations., METHOD: Conducted a within-subjects experiment to evaluate scheduling task performance in terms of scheduling efficiency, effectiveness, workload, and situation awareness while manipulating scheduling task complexity according to the number of constraints and type of constraints., RESULTS: Each participant (n = 15) completed a set of scheduling problems. Results showed main effects of the number of constraints and type of constraint on efficiency, effectiveness, and workload. Significant interactions were observed in situation awareness and workload for certain types of constraints. Results also suggest that a lower number of constraints may be manageable by novice schedulers when compared to scheduling activities without constraints., CONCLUSION: Results suggest that novice schedulers' performance decreases with a high number of constraints, and future scheduling aids may need to target a specific type of constraint., APPLICATION: Knowledge on the effect of scheduling task complexity will help design scheduling systems that will enable self-scheduling for future astronauts.

A Multi-UAV Task Allocation Algorithm Combatting Red Palm Weevil Infestation,"Al-Megren, Shiroq; Kurdi, Heba; Aldaood, Munirah F.","The spread of red palm weevil (RPW) infestation of palm trees is prevalent in many countries, causing tremendous economic losses estimated at multi-millions of dollars annually. The utilization of a swarm of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with suitable equipment has the potential to support RPW detect and treat (DAT) missions. Nevertheless, this approach raises a challenge regarding the efficient distribution of UAVs during search and detect tasks within the constraints of a mission. This paper proposes a new autonomous bio-inspired approach for efficiently allocating tasks among multiple UAVs during DAT missions. The new approach is inspired by the autonomous behaviour of bacteria as they forage for food. The performance of the proposed algorithm was benchmarked against two long-standing multi-UAV task allocation paradigms: opportunistic task allocation and auction-based heuristics, which were thoroughly tested in simulated DAT mission scenarios to comparatively assess their performance. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed algorithm, as it detected more infestations at shorter runtimes. These results validate the high flexibility, scalability, and sustainability of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 The Authors.

"From Classical Radiation to Modern Radiation: Past, Present, and Future of Radiation Mutation Breeding","Ma, Liqiu; Kong, Fuquan; Sun, Kai; Wang, Ting; Guo, Tao","Radiation mutation breeding has been used for nearly 100 years and has successfully improved crops by increasing genetic variation. Global food production is facing a series of challenges, such as rapid population growth, environmental pollution and climate change. How to feed the world's enormous human population poses great challenges to breeders. Although advanced technologies, such as gene editing, have provided effective ways to breed varieties, by editing a single or multiple specific target genes, enhancing germplasm diversity through mutation is still indispensable in modern and classical radiation breeding because it is more likely to produce random mutations in the whole genome. In this short review, the current status of classical radiation, accelerated particle and space radiation mutation breeding is discussed, and the molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced mutation are demonstrated. This review also looks into the future development of radiation mutation breeding, hoping to deepen our understanding and provide new vitality for the further development of radiation mutation breeding.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,9,,,WOS:000739086000001,10.3389/fpubh.2021.768071,,#15196,Ma 2021,,
"Effect of Green Space Environment on Air Pollutants PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, and Incidence and Mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Highly Green and Less-Green Countries.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Almutairi, Faris Jamal; Abukhalaf, Abdulelah Adnan; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood","Worldwide, over half of the global population is living in urban areas. The metropolitan areas are highly populated and environmentally non-green regions on the planet. In green space regions, plants, grass, and green vegetation prevent soil erosion, absorb air pollutants, provide fresh and clean air, and minimize the burden of diseases. Presently, the entire world is facing a turmoil situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the effect of the green space environment on air pollutants particulate matter PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), incidence and mortality of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in environmentally highly green and less-green countries. We randomly selected 17 countries based on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) data. The 60% of the EPI score is based on seven categories: ""biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem, fisheries, climate change, pollution emissions, agriculture, and water resources"". However, 40% of the score is based on four categories: ""air quality, sanitation and drinking water, heavy metals, and waste management"". The air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths were recorded from 25 January 2020, to 11 July 2021. The air pollutants ""PM2.5, PM10, CO, and O3"" were recorded from the metrological websites, Air Quality Index-AQI, 2021. The COVID-19 daily cases and deaths were obtained from the World Health Organization. The result reveals that air pollutants mean values for PM2.5 110.73 +/- 1.09 vs. 31.35 +/- 0.29; PM10 80.43 +/- 1.11 vs. 17.78 +/- 0.15; CO 7.92 +/- 0.14 vs. 2.35 +/- 0.03 were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) in environmentally highly green space countries compared to less-green countries.

Neural Networks Enhanced Optimal Admittance Control of Robot-Environment Interaction Using Reinforcement Learning,"Peng, Guangzhu; Chen, C. L. Philip; Yang, Chenguang","In this paper, an adaptive admittance control scheme is developed for robots to interact with time-varying environments. Admittance control is adopted to achieve a compliant physical robot-environment interaction, and the uncertain environment with time-varying dynamics is defined as a linear system. A critic learning method is used to obtain the desired admittance parameters based on the cost function composed of interaction force and trajectory tracking without the knowledge of the environmental dynamics. To deal with dynamic uncertainties in the control system, a neural-network (NN)-based adaptive controller with a dynamic learning framework is developed to guarantee the trajectory tracking performance.

"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Smart Agriculture: Applications, Requirements, and Challenges","Reddy Maddikunta, Praveen Kumar; Hakak, Saqib; Alazab, Mamoun; Bhattacharya, Sweta; Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy; Khan, Wazir Zada; Pham, Quoc-Viet","In the next few years, smart farming will reach each and every nook of the world. The prospects of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for smart farming are immense. However, the cost and the ease in controlling UAVs for smart farming might play an important role for motivating farmers to use UAVs in farming. Mostly, UAVs are controlled by remote controllers using radio waves. There are several technologies such as Wi-Fi or ZigBee that are also used for controlling UAVs. However, Smart Bluetooth (also referred to as Bluetooth Low Energy) is a wireless technology used to transfer data over short distances. Smart Bluetooth is cheaper than other technologies and has the advantage of being available on every smart phone. Farmers can use any smart phone to operate their respective UAVs along with Bluetooth Smart enabled agricultural sensors in the future. However, certain requirements and challenges need to be addressed before UAVs can be operated for smart agriculture-related applications.

Optimizing mitochondrial maintenance in extended neuronal projections,"Agrawal, Anamika; Koslover, Elena F.","Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.Author summary Neurons contain long projections termed axons and dendrites and a small central body that is responsible for much of cellular biosynthesis. Mitochondria, the energy hubs of a cell, are synthesized in the soma and actively transported to distant sites of high energy demand. Given the extreme distances between these sites and the soma, maintaining distal mitochondrial health poses a substantial challenge. Defects in mitochondrial transport and maintenance are associated with several neurological disorders. Fortunately, mitochondria stationed at distant sites can be 'serviced' by passing mitochondria that emerge from the soma and move around the neuron, as well as through low levels of local protein synthesis. We develop mathematical models for two strategies of mitochondrial maintenance: one with direct protein exchange between moving and stationary mitochondria ('Space Station') and the other with moving mitchondria occasionally replacing stationary ones at the demand sites ('Changing of the Guard'). We find that only a few servicing events and a small motile pool form optimal conditions for maintaining mitochondrial health. The system can be improved further by selectively removing and recycling some unhealthy mitochondria. Our results are consistent with observations of mitochondrial behavior in neurons and form a basis for future quantitative study of mitochondrial maintenance.",2021,,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,17,6,,WOS:000664329600003,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009073,,#11095,Agrawal 2021,,
Comprehensive analyses of plant hormones in etiolated pea and maize seedlings grown under microgravity conditions in space: Relevance to the International Space Station experiment “Auxin Transport”,"Yamazaki, C.; Yamazaki, T.; Kojima, M.; Takebayashi, Y.; Sakakibara, H.; Uheda, E.; Oka, M.; Kamada, M.; Shimazu, T.; Kasahara, H.; Sano, H.; Suzuki, T.; Higashibata, A.; Miyamoto, K.; Ueda, J.","Functional relationships between endogenous levels of plant hormones in the growth and development of shoots in etiolated Alaska pea and etiolated Golden Cross Bantam maize seedlings under different gravities were investigated in the “Auxin Transport” experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Comprehensive analyses of 31 species of plant hormones of pea and maize seedlings grown under microgravity (μg) in space and 1 g conditions were conducted. Principal component analysis (PCA) and a multiple regression analysis with the dataset from the plant hormone analysis of the etiolated pea seedlings grown under μg and 1 g conditions in the presence and absence of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) revealed endogenous levels of auxin correlated positively with bending and length of epicotyls. Endogenous cytokinins correlated negatively with them. These results suggest an interaction of auxin and cytokinins in automorphogenesis and growth inhibition of etiolated Alaska pea epicotyls grown under μg conditions in space. Less polar auxin transport with reduced endogenous levels of auxin increased endogenous levels of cytokinins, resulting in changing the growth direction of epicotyls and inhibiting growth. On the other hand, almost no close relationship between endogenous plant hormone levels and growth and development in etiolated maize seedlings grown was observed under μg conditions in space, as per Schulze et al. (1992). However, endogenous levels of IAA in the seedlings grown under μg conditions in space were significantly higher than those grown on Earth, similar to the cases of polar auxin transport already reported.",2023,,Life Sciences in Space Research,36,"(Yamazaki C., yamazaki.chiaki@jaxa.jp; Yamazaki T., yamazaki.tomokazu@jaxa.jp; Suzuki T., suzuki.tomomi@jaxa.jp; Higashibata A., higashibata.akira@jaxa.jp) Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, 2-1-1 Sengen, Ibaraki, Tsukuba, Japan(Kojima M., mikiko@riken.j",138-146,,10.1016/j.lssr.2022.10.005,,#3957,Yamazaki 2023,,
Core-shell protein clusters comprising haemoglobin and recombinant feline serum albumin as an artificial O<sub>2</sub> carrier for cats,"Yokomaku, Kyoko; Akiyama, Motofusa; Morita, Yoshitsugu; Kihira, Kiyohito; Komatsu, Teruyuki","This report describes the synthesis and structure of core-shell protein clusters comprising haemoglobin (Hb) at the centre and recombinant feline serum albumin (rFSA) at the exterior, named as haemoglobin-albumin clusters (Hb-rFSA(3)). Specifically, we highlight their capability as an artificial O-2 carrier that can be used as a red blood cell (RBC) substitute for cats, the most populous pet animal in the world. First, rFSA was expressed by genetic engineering using Pichia yeast. The proteins show identical features to the native FSA derived from feline plasma. Single crystals of rFSA were prepared under a microgravity environment on the international space station (ISS), from which the structure was first revealed at 3.4 angstrom resolution. Subsequently, bovine Hb was wrapped covalently by rFSA using an alpha-succinimidyl-epsilon-maleimide crosslinker, yielding Hb-rFSA(3) clusters. Three rFSA entities enfolded the Hb nuclei satisfactorily, giving the protein clusters a negative surface net charge (pI = 4.7) and preventing an immunological response against anti-Hb antibodies. The O-2 affinity was higher (P-50 = 9 Torr) than that of the native Hb.

Procedures for chemical fixation in immunohistochemical analyses of PIN proteins regulating polar auxin transport: Relevance to spaceflight experiments.,"Kamada, Motoshi; Miyamoto, Kensuke; Oka, Mariko; Uheda, Eiji; Ueda, Junichi; Higashibata, Akira","The mechanism by which gravity controls the polar transport of auxin, a plant hormone regulating multiple physiological processes in higher plants, remains unclear, although an important role of PIN proteins as efflux carriers/facilitators in polar auxin transport is suggested. We are going to study the effect of microgravity on the polar transport of auxin, focusing on the cellular localization of its efflux carrier, PsPIN1 in etiolated pea seedlings and ZmPIN1a in etiolated maize seedlings grown under microgravity conditions on the International Space Station (ISS) using immunohistochemical analyses according to space experimental plans (Ueda, 2016). To obtain adequate results regarding the cellular localization of functional proteins, prolonged chemical fixation processes as well as chemical fixatives should be well-matched to the properties of functional proteins as antigens since experimental analyses will be performed on the ground after keeping samples for a long duration on the ISS. As a result of ground verification, clear detection of the cellular localization of PsPIN1 and ZmPIN1a immunohistochemically was successful based on the results of several kinds of chemical fixation tested, even when etiolated pea and maize seedlings were fixed by immersion in chemical fixative for a long duration. The addition of 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 to chemical fixative composed of 50% (v/v) ethanol and 5% (v/v) acetic acid or that of 50% (v/v) methanol and 5% (v/v) acetic acid has led to a significant improvement in the immunohistochemical detection of PsPIN1 or ZmPIN1a. These chemical fixatives were also shown to be storage-stable for a long time before use. In this study, adequate chemical fixatives and fixation protocols were developed, which can be used to detect localization of PsPIN1 and ZmPIN1a proteins in young etiolated pea and maize seedlings, respectively, using anti PsPIN1 and ZmPIN1a antibodies. These protocols can be used in spaceflight experiments to investigate the effects of the microgravity environment on the ISS on PIN protein localization in pea and maize seedlings.

Permanent phenotypic and genotypic changes of prostate cancer cells cultured in a three-dimensional rotating-wall vessel,"Rhee, HW; Zhau, HE; Pathak, S; Multani, AS; Pennanen, S; Visakorpi, T; Chung, LWK","A three-dimensional (3D) integrated rotating-wall vessel cell-culture sr;stem was used to evaluate the interaction between a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and microcarrier heads alone, or microcarrier beads previously seeded with either prostate or bone stromal cells. Upon coculture of LNCaP cells with microcarrier beads either in the presence or in the absence of prostate or bone stromal cells, 3D prostate organoids were formed with the expected hormonal responsiveness to androgen, increased cell growth, anti prostate-specific antigen production. in this communication, we define permanent phenotypic and genotypic changes of LNCaP cells upon coculture with microcarrier beads alone, or with microcarrier beads previously seeded with either prostate or bone stromal cells, Most notably, rye observed selective genetic changes, i.e., chromosomal losses or gains, as evaluated by both conventional cytogenetic and comparative genomic hybridization, in LNCaP sublines derived from the prostate organoids. Moreover, the derivative LNCaP cells appear to hare altered growth profiles, and exhibit permanent and stable changes in response to androgen, estrogen, and growth factors. The derivative LNCaP sublines showed increased anchorage-independent growth rate, and enhanced tumorigenicity and metastatic potential when inoculated orthotopically in castrated athymic mice. Our results support the hypothesis that further nonrandom genetic and phenotypic changes in prostate cancer epithelial cells can occur through an event that resembles ""adaptive mutation"" such as has been described in bacteria subjected to nutritional starvation.

This Bacillus species was found in both unclassified (entrance floors, anteroom, and air-lock) and classified (floors, cabinet tops, and air) locations. Both vegetative cells and spores of several B. pumilus isolates were exposed to 5% liquid H2O2 for 60 min. Spores of each strain exhibited higher resistance than their respective vegetative cells to liquid H2O2. Results indicate that the H2O2 resistance observed in both vegetative cells and spores is strain-specific, as certain B. pumilus strains were two to three times more resistant than a standard Bacillus subtilis dosimetry strain. An example of this trend was observed when the type strain of B. pumilus, ATCC 7061, proved sensitive, whereas several environmental strains exhibited varying degrees of resistance, to H2O2. Repeated isolation of H2O2-resistant strains of B. pumilus in a clean-room is a concern because their persistence might potentially compromise life-detection missions, which have very strict cleanliness and sterility requirements for spacecraft hardware.",2005,/,Astrobiology,5,3,391-405,,,15941382,#3254,Kempf 2005,,
A COVID-19 Emergency Response for Remote Control of a Dialysis Machine with Mobile HRI.,"Wazir, Hassam Khan; Lourido, Christian; Chacko, Sonia Mary; Kapila, Vikram","Healthcare workers face a high risk of contagion during a pandemic due to their close proximity to patients. The situation is further exacerbated in the case of a shortage of personal protective equipment that can increase the risk of exposure for the healthcare workers and even non-pandemic related patients, such as those on dialysis. In this study, we propose an emergency, non-invasive remote monitoring and control response system to retrofit dialysis machines with robotic manipulators for safely supporting the treatment of patients with acute kidney disease. Specifically, as a proof-of-concept, we mock-up the touchscreen instrument control panel of a dialysis machine and live-stream it to a remote user's tablet computer device. Then, the user performs touch-based interactions on the tablet device to send commands to the robot to manipulate the instrument controls on the touchscreen of the dialysis machine. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct an accuracy test. Moreover, we perform qualitative user studies using two modes of interaction with the designed system to measure the user task load and system usability and to obtain user feedback. The two modes of interaction included a touch-based interaction using a tablet device and a click-based interaction using a computer. The results indicate no statistically significant difference in the relatively low task load experienced by the users for both modes of interaction. Moreover, the system usability survey results reveal no statistically significant difference in the user experience for both modes of interaction except that users experienced a more consistent performance with the click-based interaction vs. the touch-based interaction. Based on the user feedback, we suggest an improvement to the proposed system and illustrate an implementation that corrects the distorted perception of the instrumentation control panel live-stream for a better and consistent user experience.",2021,,Frontiers in robotics and AI,8,,612855-612855,MEDLINE:34262944,10.3389/frobt.2021.612855,,#12970,Wazir 2021,,
Morphological and gene expression pattern changes in <i>wrky46</i> mutant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> under altered gravity conditions,"Soh, Hyuncheol; Srikanth, Krishnamoorthy; Whang, Sung Soo; Lee, Sukchan","Arabidopsis roots are important organs for gravity sensing and gravitropic response. Long-term exposure of Arabidopsis to three-dimensional (3D) clinorotation was found to result in increased expression of WRKY46. In this study, the response of wrky46 mutants, constructed by T-DNA insertion, to simulated microgravity and gravistimulation by reorientation was studied. Microgravity conditions were simulated using a 3D clinostat, which simulates weightlessness. Morphological changes, such as root coiling, waving, and multidirectional growth patterns, were observed in the wild type (WT) seedlings after only 4 days of 3D clinorotation treatment, while in the wrky46 mutant seedlings, the changes observed were minimal compared with those of WT seedlings. Polar auxin transport played an important role in the observed morphological changes. Therefore, expression of the polar auxin transport genes AUX1, PIN2, -3, -4, and -7, and ARG1 was analyzed. Their expression was found to be higher in wrky46 seedlings than in WT seedlings under 3D clinorotation. Gravistimulation by reorientation was achieved by horizontally reorienting the seedlings. Root tip bending to 90 degrees was observed in all WT seedlings within 18-20 h, whereas in mutant seedlings, bending of the root tip to a right angle took more than 20 h. AXR expression is known to directly correlate with root tip bending. The expression of AXR1, -2, -3, -4 was found to be higher in WT seedlings relative to mutant seedlings under gravistimulation by reorientation. However, their expression was relatively low in both WT and wrky46 plants under 3D clinorotation. These results suggest that WRKY46 plays an important role in the root gravitropic response, and in the reduction of polar auxin transport that is necessary for decreasing the effect of gravity due to clinorotation.",2015,,BOTANY,93,6,333-343,WOS:000355599900003,10.1139/cjb-2014-0252,,#16822,Soh 2015,,
Adaptive Neural Network Sliding Mode Control for Quad Tilt Rotor Aircraft,"Yin, Yanchao; Niu, Hongwei; Liu, Xiaobao","A novel neural network sliding mode control based on multicommunity bidirectional drive collaborative search algorithm (M-CBDCS) is proposed to design a flight controller for performing the attitude tracking control of a quad tilt rotors aircraft (QTRA). Firstly, the attitude dynamic model of the QTRA concerning propeller tension, channel arm, and moment of inertia is formulated, and the equivalent sliding mode control law is stated. Secondly, an adaptive control algorithm is presented to eliminate the approximation error, where a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to online regulate the equivalent sliding mode control law, and the novel M-CBDCS algorithm is developed to uniformly update the unknown neural network weights and essential model parameters adaptively. The nonlinear approximation error is obtained and serves as a novel leakage term in the adaptations to guarantee the sliding surface convergence and eliminate the chattering phenomenon, which benefit the overall attitude control performance for QTRA. Finally, the appropriate comparisons among the novel adaptive neural network sliding mode control, the classical neural network sliding mode control, and the dynamic inverse PID control are examined, and comparative simulations are included to verify the efficacy of the proposed control method.",2017,,COMPLEXITY,,,,WOS:000412857300001,10.1155/2017/7104708,,#11917,Yin 2017,,

The colony forming ability test was applied for survival and the MTT test for viability determination after X-irradiation. Cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells, and DNA double strand break (DSB) induction and repair by gamma H2AX immunofluorescence. The radiosensitivity of mESCs was slightly higher compared to the murine osteoblast cell line OCT-1. The viability 72 h after X-irradiation decreased dose-dependently and was higher in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Cells exposed to 2 or 7 Gy underwent a transient G2 arrest. X-irradiation induced gamma H2AX foci and they disappeared within 72 h. After 72 h of X-ray exposure, RNA was isolated and analyzed using genome-wide microarrays. The gene expression analysis revealed amongst others a regulation of developmental genes (Ada, Baz1a, Calcoco2, Htra1, Nefh, S100a6andRassf6), downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism whereas upregulation of genes related to the p53 signaling pathway. X-irradiated mESCs formed EBs and differentiated toward cardiomyocytes but their beating frequencies were lower compared to EBs from unirradiated cells. These results suggest that X-irradiation of mESCs deregulate genes related to the developmental process. The most significant biological processes found to be altered by X-irradiation in mESCs were the development of cardiovascular, nervous, circulatory and renal system. These results may explain the X-irradiation induced-embryonic lethality and malformations observed in animal studies.",2020,,CELLS,9,7,,WOS:000554306700001,10.3390/cells9071650,,#7938,Hellweg 2020,,

Shielding optimisation therefore represents a crucial goal for long-term missions, especially in deep space. In this context, the use of radiation transport codes coupled with anthropomorphic phantoms allows to simulate typical radiation exposures for astronauts behind different shielding, and to calculate doses to different organs. In this work, the FLUKA Monte Carlo code and two phantoms, a mathematical model and a voxel model, were used, taking the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) spectra from the model of Badhwar and O'Neill. The time integral spectral proton fluence of the August 1972 Solar Particle Event (SPE) was represented by an exponential function. For each aluminium shield thickness, besides total doses the contributions from primary and secondary particles for different organs and tissues were calculated separately. More specifically, organ-averaged absorbed doses, dose equivalents and a form of 'biological dose', defined on the basis of initial (clustered) DNA damage, were calculated. As expected, the SPE doses dramatically decreased with increasing shielding, and doses in internal organs were lower than in skin. The contribution of secondary particles to SPE doses was almost negligible; however it is of note that, at high shielding (10 g cm-2), most of the secondaries are neutrons. GCR organ doses remained roughly constant with increasing Al shielding. In contrast to SPE results, for the case of cosmic rays, secondary particles accounted for a significant fraction of the total dose. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",2006,,Radiation Protection Dosimetry,122,4-Jan,362-366,,10.1093/rpd/ncl438,,#6474,Trovati 2006,,

Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in varied biological processes, but the mechanism of histone modification on unloading-induced bone loss has rarely been studied. Here, we discovered for the first time that the methyltransferase Setdb1 was downregulated under the mechanical unloading both in vitro and in vivo so as to attenuate osteoblast proliferation. Furthermore, we found these interesting processes depended on the repression of Macrod2 expression triggered by Setdb1 catalyzing the formation of H3K9me3 in the promoter region. Mechanically, we revealed that Macrod2 was upregulated under mechanical unloading and suppressed osteoblast proliferation through the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, Atf7ip cooperatively contributed to osteoblast proliferation by changing the localization of Setdb1 under mechanical loading. In summary, this research elucidated the role of the Atf7ip/Setdb1/Macrod2 axis in osteoblast proliferation under mechanical unloading for the first time, which can be a potential protective strategy against unloading-induced bone loss.",2022,/,Cells,11,16,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells11162580,36010655,#845,Zhang 2022,,
Analysis of genetic variation in Ganoderma lucidum after space flight.,"Qi, Jian-Jun; Ma, Rong-Cai; Chen, Xiang-Dong; Lan, Jin","A modified CTAB method was used in the extraction of total cellular DNA of Ganoderma lucidum.

Satellite-based QKD has the potential to help to establish a global-scale quantum network, owing to the negligible photon loss and decoherence experienced in empty space. Here we report the development and launch of a low-Earth-orbit satellite for implementing decoy-state QKD-a form of QKD that uses weak coherent pulses at high channel loss and is secure because photon-number-splitting eavesdropping can be detected. We achieve a kilohertz key rate from the satellite to the ground over a distance of up to 1,200 kilometres.

People with disabilities may encounter many problems and may not be able to easily participate in various activities due to physical barriers, which may sometimes cause them to be frustrated and embarrassed. Recently, the emerging telepresence robot technology has been proposed to enable people with disabilities to increase their presence by incorporating information and communications technology (ICT) into robotics platforms. Therefore, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive analysis using comparative and elicitation studies to understand the current state of mobile telepresence robot systems and to identify the gaps that must be filled. This paper further contributes to the literature by proposing a novel telepresence robot system that adapts text-to-speech (TTS) and ICT technologies with robotics for its use as an assistant. To the authors' knowledge, the proposed system is the first MRP system that supports speech impairment and introduces emotion components into its communication function. It includes an operator site (mobile) and a remote site (robot) to allow users to control the robot from a distance and communicate with others in remote locations. It allows the user to physically interact with people and show certain emotions through the robot in remote locations, or it can accompany them to speak on their behalf. It can provide agency for both remote and in-class users through emoji-based communication and audio-video streaming with recording functionality. As shown at the end of this paper, the system was tested with 30 people, some of whom had mobility or speech disabilities, showing that the user acceptance score was above 95% and that people with disabilities liked to interact with other people using the proposed system. The users appreciated having the ability to control the robot from a distance and praised the capability to show their emotions through the robot emoji motions and to control the audio-video streaming.

"Differential proteomic analysis using isotope-coded protein-labeling strategies: Comparison, improvements and application to simulated microgravity effect on <i>Cupriavidus metallidurans</i> CH34","Leroy, Baptiste; Rosier, Caroline; Erculisse, Vanessa; Leys, Natalie; Mergeay, Max; Wattiez, Ruddy","Among differential proteomic methods based on stable isotopic labeling, isotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL) is a recent non-isobaric technique devised to label primary amines found in proteins. ICPL overcomes some of the disadvantages found in other chemical-labeling techniques, such as iTRAQ or ICAT. However, previous analyses revealed that more than 30% of the proteins identified in regular ICPL generally remain unquantified. In this study, we describe a modified version of ICPL, named Post-digest ICPL, that makes it possible to label and thus to quantify all the peptides in a sample (bottom up approach). Optimization and validation of this Post-digest ICPL approach were performed using a standard protein mixture and complex protein samples. Using this strategy, the number of proteins that were identified and quantified was greatly increased in comparison with regular ICPL and cICAT approaches. The pros and cons of this improvement are discussed. This complementary approach to traditional ICPL was applied to the analysis of modification of protein abundances in the model bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 after cultivation under simulated microgravity.

Autonomous Heading Planning and Control Method of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles for Tunnel Detection,"Xia, Tianxing; Cui, Dehao; Chu, Zhenzhong; Yu, Xing","To address the challenge of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) autonomous navigation in long-distance underwater tunnel detection tasks and improve the control performance of its heading control system, a method of autonomous heading planning and control based on sonar-ranging feedback control was proposed. This method combines UUV's autonomous heading planning technology with the heading proportion-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, optimizing the acquisition method of controller input data, to impart specific adaptive characteristics to the controller. Using the ranging principle of ultrasonic spontaneous self-collection, it is possible to obtain the yaw direction and angle of the vehicle relative to the target heading in the tunnel and continuously adjust the control law to change the heading as the vehicle's heading status changes during navigation. The effectiveness of the autonomous heading planning and control method is verified through pool experiments. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed heading planning method achieves good control effect in UUV's underwater tunnel detection heading control, and exhibits obvious advantages in long-distance closed tunnel environments.

MiR-655-3p inhibits the progression of osteoporosis by targeting LSD1 and activating BMP-2/Smad signaling pathway.,"Wang, X-J; Liu, J-W; Liu, J","Osteoporosis (OP) is one of the most common chronic metabolic bone diseases in the seniors and postmenopausal women. Plenty of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to be involved in OP progression. However, the role of miR-655-3p in osteogenic differentiation and bone formation was still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the cellular function of miR-655-3p and its underlying mechanism in OP. We found that miR-655-3p expression was downregulated in both ovariectomized (OVX) mice bone tissues and MC3T3-E1 cells treated with simulated microgravity (MG). MiR-655-3p overexpression facilitated cell differentiation but suppressed cell apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells induced by simulated MG. Mechanistically, we confirmed that lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a downstream target gene of miR-655-3p. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-655-3p activated the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)/decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) signaling pathway by suppressing LSD1 expression. Moreover, LSD1 knockdown accelerated osteogenic differentiation and inhibited apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated MG. Additionally, the OVX mouse model was established to investigate the role of miR-655-3p/LSD1 axis in vivo. The results demonstrated that LSD1 could reverse the effects triggered by the injection of adeno-associated virus-miR-655-3p on OP development.

Model for radial dependence of frequency distributions for energy imparted in nanometer volumes from HZE particles.,"Cucinotta, F A; Nikjoo, H; Goodhead, D T","This paper develops a deterministic model of frequency distributions for energy imparted (total energy deposition) in small volumes similar to DNA molecules from high-energy ions of interest for space radiation protection and cancer therapy. Frequency distributions for energy imparted are useful for considering radiation quality and for modeling biological damage produced by ionizing radiation. For high-energy ions, secondary electron (delta-ray) tracks originating from a primary ion track make dominant contributions to energy deposition events in small volumes. Our method uses the distribution of electrons produced about an ion's path and incorporates results from Monte Carlo simulation of electron tracks to predict frequency distributions for ions, including their dependence on radial distance. The contribution from primary ion events is treated using an impact parameter formalism of spatially restricted linear energy transfer (LET) and energy-transfer straggling. We validate our model by comparing it directly to results from Monte Carlo simulations for proton and alpha-particle tracks. We show for the first time frequency distributions of energy imparted in DNA structures by several high-energy ions such as cosmic-ray iron ions.

However. little is known about the effects of this parameter on the microbiological treatment options that are being proposed for Advanced Life Support (ALS) systems. Two bioreactor studies were designed to examine this variable. In the first one, six retention times ranging from 1.3 to 21.3 days--were run in duplicate, 81 working-volume continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) that were fed ALS wheat residues. Ash-free dry weight loss, carbon mineralization, soluble TOC reduction, changes in fiber content (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), bacterial numbers, and mineral recoveries were monitored. At short retention times--1.33 days--biodegradation was poor (total: 16-20%, cellulose - 12%, hemicellulose - 28%) but soluble TOC was decreased by 75-80% and recovery of major crop inorganic nutrients was adequate, except for phosphorus. A high proportion of the total bacteria (ca. 83%) was actively respiring. At the longest retention time tested, 21.3 days, biodegradation was good (total: 55-60%, cellulose ca. 70%, hemicellulose - ca. 55%) and soluble TOC was decreased by 80%. Recovery of major nutrients, except phosphorus, remained adequate. A very low proportion of total bacteria was actively respiring (ca. 16%). The second bioreactor study used potato residue to determine if even shorter retention times could be used (range 0.25-2.0 days). Although overall biodegradation deteriorated, the degradation of soluble TOC continued to be ca. 75%. We conclude that if the goal of ALS bioprocessing is maximal degradation of crop residues, including cellulose, then retention times of 10 days or longer will be needed. If the goal is to provide inorganic nutrients with the smallest volume/weight bioreactor possible, then a retention time of 1 day (or less) is sufficient.",2002,/,Bioresource technology,84,2,119-27,,,12139328,#3576,Strayer 2002,,
A comparison of quality factors and weighting factors for characterizing astronaut radiation exposures.,"Zapp, Neal; Cucinotta, Frank; Atwell, W","Radiation exposures are typically characterized by two quantities. The first is the absorbed dose, or the energy deposited per unit mass for specific types of radiation passing through specified materials. The same amount of energy deposited in material by two different types of radiation, however, can result in two different levels of risk. Because of this, for the purpose of radiation protection operations, absorbed dose is modified by a second factor intended to normalize the risk associated with a given exposure. We present here an inter-comparison of methods for this modification. First is the radiation quality factor (Q), as defined by ICRP publication 60. This quantity is related functionally to the unrestricted linear energy transfer (LET) of a given radiation, and is multiplied by the absorbed dose to derive the dose equivalent (H). The second method for modifying absorbed dose is the radiation weighting factor, also given in ICRP-60, or as modified in NCRP report 115. To implement the weighting factor, the absorbed dose resulting from incidence of a particular radiation is multiplied by a factor assigned to that type of radiation, giving the equivalent dose. We compare calculations done based on identical fields of radiation representative of that encountered by the MIR space station, applying each of these two methods. Copyright c2002 COSPAR.

The role of the MAPK pathway in the RIBEs of different linear energy transfer (LET) was investigated., MAIN METHODS: Human macrophage U937 cells were irradiated with gamma-rays or carbon ions and then co-cultured with nonirradiated HMy2.CIR (HMy) lymphocytes for different periods. The activation of MAPK proteins and the generation of intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the irradiated U937 cells were measured. Micronuclei (MN) formation in the HMy cells was applied to evaluate the bystander damage. Some U937 cells were pretreated with different MAPK inhibitors before irradiation., KEY FINDINGS: Additional MN formation was induced in the HMy cells after co-culturing with irradiated U937 cells, and the yield of this bystander MN formation was dependent on the co-culture period with gamma-ray irradiation but remained high after 1h of co-culture with carbon irradiation. Further investigations disclosed that the time response of the RIBEs had a relationship with LET, where ERK played a different role from JNK and p38 in regulating RIBEs by regulating the generation of the bystander signaling factors NO and ROS., SIGNIFICANCE: The finding that the RIBE of high-LET radiation could persist for a much longer period than that of gamma-rays implies that particle radiation during space flight could have a high risk of long-term harmful effects.

The success of such a mission requires the lightsail to provide maximal acceleration while featuring beam-riding stability under the illumination of an intense laser beam during the launch phase. Moreover, the large-area lightsail can be harnessed to improve the margin in the photon-starved downlink channel throughout the communication phase by maximizing the gain of the transmitter despite extending the acceleration period and reducing the stability margin due to the elimination of a portion of the propulsion segments. Owing to the potential of metasurfaces to serve as low-weight versatile multifunctional photonic components, metasurface-based lightsails or metasails are deemed to be ideal candidates to simultaneously address the requirements of photonic propulsion and optical communication in laser-driven deep-space probes. Here, we demonstrate the design of a multifunctional metasail for providing high acceleration and enabling the self-stabilized beam-riding of a spacecraft with a detached payload from the sail while maximizing the transmission gain in the downlink optical communication. The metasail consists of two interleaved sub-arrays of dielectric unit cells operating based on the Pancharatnam-Berry geometric phase, optimized to meet the propulsion and communication requirements, respectively. The beam-riding stability of the sail is analyzed through simulation of the motion trajectory during the acceleration phase, while taking into account the effect of the relativistic Doppler shift, and the downlink communication performance is enabled by providing the required conjugate phase by the metasail elements, resulting in beam collimation. The obtained results verify the multifunctionality of the platform and point toward the promise of metasails for extended mission applications.

GA Based Adaptive Singularity-Robust Path Planning of Space Robot for On-Orbit Detection,"Wu, Jianwei; Bin, Deer; Feng, Xiaobing; Wen, Zhongpu; Zhang, Yin","As a new on-orbit detection platform, the space robot could ensure stable and reliable operation of spacecraft in complex space environments. The tracking accuracy of the space manipulator end-effector is crucial to the detection precision. In this paper, the Cartesian path planning method of velocity level inverse kinematics based on generalized Jacobian matrix (GJM) is proposed. The GJM will come across singularity issue in path planning, which leads to the infinite or incalculable joint velocity. To solve this issue, firstly, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is used for exposition of the singularity avoidance principle of the damped least squares (DLS) method. After that, the DLS method is improved by introducing an adaptive damping factor which changes with the singularity. Finally, in order to improve the tracking accuracy of the singularity-robust algorithm, the objective function is established, and two adaptive parameters are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation of a 6-DOF free-floating space robot is carried out, and the results show that, compared with DLS method, the proposed method could improve the tracking accuracy of space manipulator end-effector.",2018,,COMPLEXITY,,,,WOS:000434857500001,10.1155/2018/3702916,,#8790,Wu 2018,,
Potential Involvement of the Ocular Glymphatic System in Optic Disc Edema in Astronauts.,"Wostyn, Peter; De Winne, Frank; Stern, Claudia; Mader, Thomas H; Gibson, Charles Robert; De Deyn, Peter Paul","INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of the astronauts who spend extended periods in microgravity develop ophthalmic abnormalities, including optic disc edema, optic nerve sheath distention, globe flattening, chorioretinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts. A constellation of these neuro-ophthalmic findings has been termed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. An increased understanding of factors contributing to this syndrome is one of the top priorities for ESA and NASA because the length of missions is expected to increase substantially in the future. As discussed in the present article, the very recent discovery of an ocular glymphatic clearance system can potentially help to unlock mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced optic disc edema. Observations pertaining to the ocular glymphatic pathway provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis, originally proposed by our group, suggesting that the glymphatic outflow from the eye into the optic nerve may be impeded under prolonged microgravity conditions, leading to optic disc edema.

Current problems of space cardiology,"Baevsky, R. M.","The development of space cardiology is considered, from the first flights of animals and humans to the studies conducted on board International Space Station (ISS). The material is recounted in four sections in accordance with the theoretical statements presented in the book 'Space Cardiology' (1967). The first section is analysis of rearrangement of blood circulation under the conditions of microgravity. Long-term microgravity has been demonstrated to require mobilization of additional functional reserves of the body. During the first six months of the flight, the cardiovascular homeostasis is supported by the regulatory mechanisms of the blood circulation system, whereas in the case of a more prolonged impact of microgravity, intersystem control is actively involved (suprasegmental divisions of autonomic regulation). In the second section dealing with the roles of the right and left divisions of the heart in adaptation to microgravity of the cardiovascular system, the important role of the right heart at the initial stage of a space flight (SF) is emphasized. The third section addresses the problem of reducing the orthostatic stability; this study has been initiated as early as the first manned space flights. The results obtained on board ISS testify to the importance of evaluating the functional reserves of the blood circulation system. The fourth section presents data on the new methods of myocardial examination that are to be soon introduced into SF medical provision. In conclusion, some new projects in space cardiology are discussed.

Obstacle effects on electrocommunication with applications to object detection of underwater robots,"Chen, Yu-Ting; Wang, Wei; Li, Liang; Kelly, Ryan; Xie, Guangming","Some fish species communicate electrically (termed electrocommunication) in turbid waters where other communication modalities fail. Inspired by this biological phenomenon, we have developed an artificial electrocommunication system for underwater robots (Wang et al 2017 Bioinspir. Biomimetics 12 036002). Due to the complex terrain of the ocean, electrocommunication could be affected by potential obstacles. In this paper, we investigate the obstacle effects on electrocommunication in a quasi-two-dimensional water environment. We first employ Fresnel zone theory to theoretically analyze the obstacle effects on electrocommunication. We then simplify the ocean terrain into 32 types of obstacles according to their material, relative location, geometry, and size, and use ANSYS Maxwell to simulate the effect of these obstacles on electrocommunication. We fabricate the same types of obstacles as in the simulation, and further conduct electrocommunication experiments with these obstacles in a swimming pool. Both the simulations and experiments show that the material, relative location, geometry, and size of the obstacles all affect the electrocommunication to varying degrees. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify and detect underwater objects based on the obtained obstacle effects, indicating that electrocommunication could be a new viable method for underwater object detection.",2019,,BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS,14,5,,WOS:000481927100002,10.1088/1748-3190/ab336c,,#12791,Chen 2019,,
Design and Implementation of an ML and IoT Based Adaptive Traffic-Management System for Smart Cities,"Lilhore, Umesh Kumar; Imoize, Agbotiname Lucky; Li, Chun-Ta; Simaiya, Sarita; Pani, Subhendu Kumar; Goyal, Nitin; Kumar, Arun; Lee, Cheng-Chi","The rapid growth in the number of vehicles has led to traffic congestion, pollution, and delays in logistic transportation in metropolitan areas. IoT has been an emerging innovation, moving the universe towards automated processes and intelligent management systems. This is a critical contribution to automation and smart civilizations. Effective and reliable congestion management and traffic control help save many precious resources. An IoT-based ITM system set of sensors is embedded in automatic vehicles and intelligent devices to recognize, obtain, and transmit data. Machine learning (ML) is another technique to improve the transport system. The existing transport-management solutions encounter several challenges resulting in traffic congestion, delay, and a high fatality rate. This research work presents the design and implementation of an Adaptive Traffic-management system (ATM) based on ML and IoT. The design of the proposed system is based on three essential entities: vehicle, infrastructure, and events. The design utilizes various scenarios to cover all the possible issues of the transport system. The proposed ATM system also utilizes the machine-learning-based DBSCAN clustering method to detect any accidental anomaly. The proposed ATM model constantly updates traffic signal schedules depending on traffic volume and estimated movements from nearby crossings. It significantly lowers traveling time by gradually moving automobiles across green signals and decreases traffic congestion by generating a better transition. The experiment outcomes reveal that the proposed ATM system significantly outperformed the conventional traffic-management strategy and will be a frontrunner for transportation planning in smart-city-based transport systems.

Growth Hormone Levels After Flywheel Ergometer Exercise: Correlation with Independent Variables,"Caruso, John F.; Coday, Michael A.; Monda, Julie K.; Ramey, Elizabeth S.; Hastings, Lori P.; Marshall, Mallory R.","Introduction: In-flight muscle mass and strength losses are likely exacerbated by low growth hormone (GH) concentrations. Factors associated with exercise may foretell resultant GH levels and thereby help blunt future mass and strength losses. Methods: To assess the ability of variables to predict GH variance from resistive exercise done on a flywheel ergometer (FE) designed for in-flight exercise, Subjects (N = 17) performed three types of workouts on the device. With a randomized design, Subjects performed the workouts with the intent to determine if changes in post-exercise GH concentrations are impacted by contractile mode and workload. Body mass, blood lactate (BLa(-)) concentrations, and peak angular velocity (PAV), average power (AP), and total work (TW) from workouts attempted to predict GH variance. Pre-exercise blood draws, and at 1 and 30 min alter workouts, were Used to determine GH concentrations. BLa(-) levels were measured before workouts and at 5 min post-exercise. Delta (delta, post - pre) and 30-min post-workout GH levels served as criterion variables. Results: Multivariate regression with an alpha <= 0.05 yielded the following significant prediction equation: delta GH = 13.64 - 0.014(body mass) - 0.607(post-exercise BLa(-)) + 0.6.59(delta BLa-) - 0.624(PAV) + 0.653(TW) + 0.147(AP). Discussion: Univariate correlations show body mass, delta BLa(-), and TW were the best predictors of delta GH variance.

Reductions in circulating endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels in healthy human subjects exposed to chronic stressors,"Yi, Buqing; Nichiporuk, Igor; Nicolas, Michel; Schneider, Stefan; Feuerecker, Matthias; Vassilieva, Galina; Thieme, Detlef; Schelling, Gustav; Chouker, Alexander","Increasing evidence indicates that chronic stress, such as social isolation, plays an important role in the development of a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders. Meanwhile, chronic stress imposed by prolonged isolation and confinement in the spacecraft is also one of the major concerns for the health of future interplanetary space travelers. Preclinical studies suggest that the peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) system is involved in the regulation of the stress response and eCB signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. However, there are only few human studies addressing this topic, of which most focusing on patients who have already developed a certain type of disorder. It remains unknown whether chronic stress may affect eCB signaling in healthy humans. A 520-d isolation and confinement study simulating a flight to Mars provided an extraordinary chance to study the effects of prolonged stress in healthy humans. During the study period, the participants lived in confinement and could not meet their families, friends, or strangers for more than 500 days. We examined the impact of chronic exposure to isolation and confinement through monitoring their psychological state, brain cortical activity, sympathetic adrenal-medullary system response and eCB signaling response. We observed reduced positive emotion ratings, decreased brain cortical activities and high levels of catecholamine release, indicating that prolonged exposure to isolation and confinement stressors may bring about changes both psychologically and physiologically. Importantly, for eCB signaling response, blood concentrations of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but not anandamide (AEA), were significantly reduced (p < 0.001), suggesting that dysregulation of 2-AG signaling might be specifically implicated in the response to chronic stressors.

Morphologic Characteristics and Proliferation of Rabbit Corneal Stromal Cells Onto Complexes of Collagen-Chitosan-Sodium Hyaluronate Under Simulated Microgravity,"Li, Xiaoxia; Yang, Yan; Li, Qinhua; Dai, Ying; Wang, Chan; Chen, Jiansu","PURPOSE. We investigated the morphologic characteristics and proliferation of rabbit corneal stromal cells (CSCs) onto scaffolds under simulated microgravity.METHODS. Rabbit CSCs were cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) and static condition. Complexes of collagen-chitosan-sodium hyaluronate with pores were used as scaffolds. Rotational speed was set at 15, 20, and 30 rpm in the first, second, and third weeks of culture, respectively. Histology, immunofluorescence staining, atomic force microscope (AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) examinations were performed. The cell proliferation was analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.RESULTS. In the SMG group, more CSCs adhered to the carriers in 24 hours. Confocal microscopic evaluation showed aggregated cells positively immunostained with vimentin. The SEM displayed the complex network of triangular or polygonal dendritic morphology of the cell bodies with many fine and long processes, which adhered to the scaffolds tightly. After 18 days of SMG culture, keratocyte-like CSCs with rich cell interconnections not only grew on the surface, but also into the interior of scaffolds. There were degradation phenomena in scaffolds in the SMG condition. Under static condition, cells just grew on scaffolds forming a monolayer. Cells showed elongating spindle shape and developed less processes. The absorbance values of the CCK-8 assay in the SMG group were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in the conventional group.CONCLUSIONS. The condition of SMG and porous collagen-chitosan-sodium hyaluronate scaffolds facilitate the proliferation of CSCs. Cells showed robust growing characteristics and morphologic properties of keratocytes. The techniques for microgravity culture of keratocyte-like CSCs on scaffolds can yield cell aggregates or cell sheets that are favorable to the reconstruction of tissue engineering of the corneal stromal layer.",2013,,INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,54,10,6877-6885,WOS:000326567700048,10.1167/iovs.13-12709,,#8653,Li 2013,,

An Invertible Mathematical Model of Cortical Bone's Adaptation to Mechanical Loading,"Prasad, Jitendra; Goyal, Ajay","Determination of mechanical loading regimen that would induce a prescribed new bone formation rate and its site-specific distribution, may be desirable to treat some orthopaedic conditions such as bone loss due to muscle disuse, e.g. because of space flight, bed-rest, osteopenia etc. Site-specific new bone formation has been determined earlier experimentally and numerically for a given loading regimen; however these models are mostly non-invertible, which means that they cannot be easily inverted to predict loading parameters for a desired new bone formation. The present work proposes an invertible model of bone remodeling, which can predict loading parameters such as peak strain, or magnitude and direction of periodic forces for a desired or prescribed site-specific mineral apposition rate (MAR), and vice versa. This fast, mathematical model has a potential to be developed into an important aid for orthopaedic surgeons for prescribing exercise or exogenous loading of bone to treat bone-loss due to muscle disuse.",2019,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,WOS:000463984600048,10.1038/s41598-019-42378-5,,#13747,Prasad 2019,,
Neurophysiology of space travel: energetic solar particles cause cell type-specific plasticity of neurotransmission,"Lee, Sang-Hun; Dudok, Barna; Parihar, Vipan K.; Jung, Kwang-Mook; Zoldi, Miklos; Kang, Young-Jin; Maroso, Mattia; Alexander, Allyson L.; Nelson, Gregory A.; Piomelli, Daniele; Katona, Istvan; Limoli, Charles L.; Soltesz, Ivan","In the not too distant future, humankind will embark on one of its greatest adventures, the travel to distant planets. However, deep space travel is associated with an inevitable exposure to radiation fields. Space-relevant doses of protons elicit persistent disruptions in cognition and neuronal structure. However, whether spacerelevant irradiation alters neurotransmission is unknown. Within the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for cognition, perisomatic inhibitory control of pyramidal cells (PCs) is supplied by two distinct cell types, the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1)-expressing basket cells (CB1BCs) and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PVINs). Mice subjected to low-dose proton irradiation were analyzed using electrophysiological, biochemical and imaging techniques months after exposure. In irradiated mice, GABA release from CB1BCs onto PCs was dramatically increased. This effect was abolished by CB1 blockade, indicating that irradiation decreased CB1-dependent tonic inhibition of GABA release. These alterations in GABA release were accompanied by decreased levels of the major CB1 ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol. In contrast, GABA release from PVINs was unchanged, and the excitatory connectivity from PCs to the interneurons also underwent cell type-specific alterations. These results demonstrate that energetic charged particles at space-relevant low doses elicit surprisingly selective long-term plasticity of synaptic microcircuits in the hippocampus. The magnitude and persistent nature of these alterations in synaptic function are consistent with the observed perturbations in cognitive performance after irradiation, while the high specificity of these changes indicates that it may be possible to develop targeted therapeutic interventions to decrease the risk of adverse events during interplanetary travel.",2017,,BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,222,5,2345-2357,WOS:000405090500022,10.1007/s00429-016-1345-3,,#13200,Lee 2017,,

The Iterative Learning Gain That Optimizes Real-Time Torque Tracking for Ankle Exoskeletons in Human Walking Under Gait Variations,"Zhang, Juanjuan; Collins, Steven H.","Lower-limb exoskeletons often use torque control to manipulate energy flow and ensure human safety. The accuracy of the applied torque greatly affects how well the motion is assisted and therefore improving it is always of interest. Feed-forward iterative learning, which is similar to predictive stride-wise integral control, has proven an effective compensation to feedback control for torque tracking in exoskeletons with complicated dynamics during human walking. Although the intention of iterative learning was initially to benefit average tracking performance over multiple strides, we found that, after proper gain tuning, it can also help improve real-time torque tracking. We used theoretical analysis to predict an optimal iterative-learning gain as the inverse of the passive actuator stiffness. Walking experiments resulted in an optimum gain equal to 0.99 +/- 0.38 times the predicted value, confirming our hypothesis.

"PIEZO1, sensing the touch during erythropoiesis","Caulier, Alexis; Garcon, Loic","Purpose of reviewAwarding the 2021 Nobel to Ardem Patapoutian for the discovery of the PIEZO mechanotransducers has emphasized the importance of touch-sensing mechanisms in cell physiology. It is well known that PIEZO1 is expressed at the surface of red blood cells where it adjusts their hydration status under mechanical constraints. Besides this, recent findings suggest that PIEZO1 plays a broader role in erythroid lineage. This review aims to actualize the knowledge on PIEZO1 functions all along erythropoiesis.Recent findingsPIEZO1 is expressed in erythroid progenitors, and controls proliferation and differentiation of nucleated cells, as well as maturation of reticulocytes. As PIEZO1 detects displacements in the range of cell-cell interactions, it might mediate the interaction between the differentiating cells and their microenvironment through an inside-out activation of integrins on human erythroblasts as suggested by in-vitro data. Moreover, PIEZO1 is also expressed at the surface of macrophages where it regulates red blood cells clearance through erythrophagocytosis.SummaryThese new findings on PIEZO1 suggest a continuous effect of mechanotransduction all over erythropoiesis from progenitors to clearance of red blood cells.

Modeling and Analysis of RFI Impacts on Imaging between Geosynchronous SAR and Low Earth Orbit SAR,"Dong, Xichao; Sui, Yi; Li, Yuanhao; Chen, Zhiyang; Hu, Cheng","Due to the short revisit time and large coverage of Geosynchronous synthetic aperture radars (GEO SARs) and the increasing number of low earth orbit synthetic aperture radar (LEO SAR) constellations, radio frequency interference (RFI) between GEO SARs and LEO SARs may occur, deteriorating the quality of SAR images. Traditional methods only simplify RFI to noise-like interference without considering the signal characteristics. In this paper, to accurately evaluate the impacts of GEO-to-LEO RFI and LEO-to-GEO RFI on imaging quantitatively, an RFI-impact quantitative analysis model is established. Taking account of the chirp signal form of SAR systems, the RFI power and image Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) are theoretically deduced and validated by numerical experiments. Based on the proposed method, the SAR image quality under different system parameters and bistatic configurations is estimated, and the probability of different configurations is also given. The results show that specular bistatic scattering RFI between GEO SARs and LEO SARs has serious effects on imaging, and the probability can approach 2% for certain orbital parameters and will become higher as LEO SAR constellations increase in the future, implying the necessity to suppress the RFI between the GEO SAR and the LEO SAR system.",2022,,REMOTE SENSING,14,13,,WOS:000825666300001,10.3390/rs14133048,,#15420,Dong 2022,,

Dual-quaternion based fault-tolerant control for spacecraft formation flying with finite-time convergence.,"Dong, Hongyang; Hu, Qinglei; Ma, Guangfu","Study results of developing control system for spacecraft formation proximity operations between a target and a chaser are presented. In particular, a coupled model using dual quaternion is employed to describe the proximity problem of spacecraft formation, and a nonlinear adaptive fault-tolerant feedback control law is developed to enable the chaser spacecraft to track the position and attitude of the target even though its actuator occurs fault.

A closed-loop brain-computer interface with augmented reality feedback for industrial human-robot collaboration,"Ji, Zhenrui; Liu, Quan; Xu, Wenjun; Yao, Bitao; Liu, Jiayi; Zhou, Zude","Industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC) aims to combine human intelligence and robotic capability to achieve higher productiveness. In industrial HRC, the communication between humans and robots is essential to enhance the understanding of the intent of each other to make a more fluent collaboration. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that could record the user's brain activity that can be translated into interaction messages (e.g., control commands) to the outside world, which can build a direct and efficient communication channel between human and robot. However, due to lacking information feedback mechanisms, it is challenging for BCI to control robots with a high degree of freedom with a limited number of classifiable mental states. To address this problem, this paper proposes a closed-loop BCI with contextual visual feedback by an augmented reality (AR) headset. In such BCI, the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns from the multiple voluntary eye blinks are considered the input and its online detection algorithm is proposed whose average accuracy can reach 94.31%. Moreover, an AR-enable information feedback interface is designed to achieve an interactive robotic path planning. A case study of an industrial HRC assembly task is also developed to show that the proposed closed-up BCI could shorten the time of user input in human-robot interaction.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,124,9,3083-3098,WOS:000694788700001,10.1007/s00170-021-07937-z,,#10917,Ji 2023,,
"Ubiquitous UAVs: A Cloud Based Framework for Storing, Accessing and Processing Huge Amount of Video Footage in an Efficient Way","Efstathiou, Nectarios; Skitsas, Michael; Psaroudakis, Chrysostomos; Koutras, Nikolaos","Nowadays, video surveillance cameras are used for the protection and monitoring of a huge number of facilities worldwide. An important element in such surveillance systems is the use of aerial video streams originating from on-board sensors located on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Video surveillance using UAVs represent a vast amount of video to be transmitted, stored, analyzed and visualized in a real-time way. As a result, the introduction and development of systems able to handle huge amount of data become a necessity. In this paper, a new approach for the collection, transmission and storage of aerial videos and metadata is introduced. The objective of this work is twofold. First, the integration of the appropriate equipment in order to capture and transmit real-time video including metadata (i.e. position coordinates, target) from the UAV to the ground and, second, the utilization of the ADITESS Versatile Media Content Management System (VMCMS-GE) for storing of the video stream and the appropriate metadata. Beyond the storage, VMCMS-GE provides other efficient management capabilities such as searching and processing of videos, along with video transcoding. For the evaluation and demonstration of the proposed framework we execute a use case where the surveillance of critical infrastructure and the detection of suspicious activities is performed. Collected video Transcodingis subject of this evaluation as well.",2017,,FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2017),10444,,,WOS:000422619600012,10.1117/12.2275333,,#11976,Efstathiou 2017,,

Effects of High Glucose on Human Endothelial Cells Exposed to Simulated Microgravity.,"Joksiene, Justina; Sahana, Jayashree; Wehland, Markus; Schulz, Herbert; Cortes-Sanchez, Jose Luis; Prat-Duran, Judit; Grimm, Daniela; Simonsen, Ulf","A diabetogenic state induced by spaceflight provokes stress and health problems in astronauts. Microgravity (microg) is one of the main stressors in space causing hyperglycaemia. However, the underlying molecular pathways and synergistic effects of microg and hyperglycaemia are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of high glucose on EA.hy926 endothelial cells in simulated microg (s-microg) using a 3D clinostat and static normogravity (1g) conditions. After 14 days of cell culture under s-microg and 1g conditions, we compared the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammation, glucose metabolism, and apoptosis-related genes and proteins through qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses, respectively. Apoptosis was evaluated via TUNEL staining. Gene interactions were examined via STRING analysis. Our results show that glucose concentrations had a weaker effect than altered gravity. microg downregulated the ECM gene and protein expression and had a stronger influence on glucose metabolism than hyperglycaemia. Moreover, hyperglycaemia caused more pronounced changes in 3D cultures than in 2D cultures, including bigger and a greater number of spheroids, upregulation of NOX4 and the apoptotic proteins NF-kappaB and CASP3, and downregulation of fibronectin and transglutaminase-2.

"Blood volume: importance and adaptations to exercise training, environmental stresses, and trauma/sickness.","Sawka, M N; Convertino, V A; Eichner, E R; Schnieder, S M; Young, A J","This paper reviews the influence of several perturbations (physical exercise, heat stress, terrestrial altitude, microgravity, and trauma/sickness) on adaptations of blood volume (BV), erythrocyte volume (EV), and plasma volume (PV). Exercise training can induce BV expansion: PV expansion usually occurs immediately, but EV expansion takes weeks. EV and PV expansion contribute to aerobic power improvements associated with exercise training. Repeated heat exposure induces PV expansion but does not alter EV. PV expansion does not improve thermoregulation, but EV expansion improves thermoregulation during exercise in the heat. Dehydration decreases PV (and increases plasma tonicity) which elevates heat strain and reduces exercise performance. High altitude exposure causes rapid (hours) plasma loss. During initial weeks at altitude, EV is unaffected, but a gradual expansion occurs with extended acclimatization. BV adjustments contribute, but are not key, to altitude acclimatization. Microgravity decreases PV and EV which contribute to orthostatic intolerance and decreased exercise capacity in astronauts. PV decreases may result from lower set points for total body water and central venous pressure, while EV decreases may result from increased erythrocyte destruction. Trauma, renal disease, and chronic diseases cause anemia from hemorrhage and immune activation which suppresses erythropoiesis. The re-establishment of EV is associated with healing, improved life quality, and exercise capabilities for these injured/sick persons.",2000,/,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,32,2,332-48,,,10694114,#3795,Sawka 2000,,
Towards Real-Time Service from Remote Sensing: Compression of Earth Observatory Video Data via Long-Term Background Referencing,"Xiao, Jing; Zhu, Rong; Hu, Ruimin; Wang, Mi; Zhu, Ying; Chen, Dan; Li, Deren","City surveillance enables many innovative applications of smart cities. However, the real-time utilization of remotely sensed surveillance data via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or video satellites is hindered by the considerable gap between the high data collection rate and the limited transmission bandwidth. High efficiency compression of the data is in high demand. Long-term background redundancy (LBR) (in contrast to local spatial/temporal redundancies in a single video clip) is a new form of redundancy common in Earth observatory video data (EOVD). LBR is induced by the repetition of static landscapes across multiple video clips and becomes significant as the number of video clips shot of the same area increases. Eliminating LBR improves EOVD coding efficiency considerably. First, this study proposes eliminating LBR by creating a long-term background referencing library (LBRL) containing high-definition geographically registered images of an entire area. Then, it analyzes the factors affecting the variations in the image representations of the background. Next, it proposes a method of generating references for encoding current video and develops the encoding and decoding framework for EOVD compression. Experimental results show that encoding UAV video clips with the proposed method saved an average of more than 54% bits using references generated under the same conditions. Bitrate savings reached 25-35% when applied to satellite video data with arbitrarily collected reference images. Applying the proposed coding method to EOVD will facilitate remote surveillance, which can foster the development of online smart city applications.",2018,,REMOTE SENSING,10,6,,WOS:000436561800070,10.3390/rs10060876,,#10808,Xiao 2018,,
Clinorotation upregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase by inhibiting AP-1 activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"Wang, Yong-Chun; Zhang, Shu; Du, Ting-Yuan; Wang, Bing; Sun, Xi-Qing","Alterations of nitric oxide contribute to post-flight orthostatic intolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the mechanisms underlying regulation of iNOS by simulated microgravity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Clinorotation, a simulated-model of microgravity, increased iNOS expression and promoter activity in HUVECs. The transactivations of NF-kappaB and AP-1 were suppressed by 24 h clinorotation. A key role for AP-1, but not NF-kappaB in the regulation of iNOS was shown. (1) PDTC, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, had no effect on clinorotation upregulation of iNOS. (2) SP600125, a JNK-specific inhibitor, which resulted in inhibition of AP-1 activity, enhanced the iNOS expression and promoter activity in clinorotation. (3) Overexpression of AP-1 remarkably attenuated the upregulation effect of clinorotation. These findings indicate that clinorotation upregulates iNOS in HUVECs by a mechanism dependent on suppression of AP-1, but not NF-kappaB. These results support a key role for AP-1 in the signaling of postflight orthostatic intolerance.

The Vestibular System: A Newly Identified Regulator of Bone Homeostasis Acting Through the Sympathetic Nervous System,"Vignaux, G.; Besnard, S.; Denise, P.; Elefteriou, F.","The vestibular system is a small bilateral structure located in the inner ear, known as the organ of balance and spatial orientation. It senses head orientation and motion, as well as body motion in the three dimensions of our environment. It is also involved in non-motor functions such as postural control of blood pressure. These regulations are mediated via anatomical projections from vestibular nuclei to brainstem autonomic centers and are involved in the maintenance of cardiovascular function via sympathetic nerves. Age-associated dysfunction of the vestibular organ contributes to an increased incidence of falls, whereas muscle atrophy, reduced physical activity, cellular aging, and gonadal deficiency contribute to bone loss. Recent studies in rodents suggest that vestibular dysfunction might also alter bone remodeling and mass more directly, by affecting the outflow of sympathetic nervous signals to the skeleton and other tissues. This review will summarize the findings supporting the influence of vestibular signals on bone homeostasis, and the potential clinical relevance of these findings.",2015,,CURRENT OSTEOPOROSIS REPORTS,13,4,198-205,WOS:000357127300002,10.1007/s11914-015-0271-2,,#17339,Vignaux 2015,,

Distinct Motor Plans Form and Retrieve Distinct Motor Memories for Physically Identical Movements,"Hirashima, Masaya; Nozaki, Daichi","We can adapt movements to a novel dynamic environment (e.g., tool use, microgravity, and perturbation) by acquiring an internal model of the dynamics [1-3]. Although multiple environments can be learned simultaneously if each environment is experienced with different limb movement kinematics [4-7], it is controversial as to whether multiple internal models for a particular movement can be learned and flexibly retrieved according to behavioral contexts [7-14]. Here, we address this issue by using a novel visuomotor task. While participants reached to each of two targets located at a clockwise or counter-clockwise position, a gradually increasing visual rotation was applied in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, respectively, to the on-screen cursor representing the unseen hand position. This procedure implicitly led participants to perform physically identical pointing movements irrespective of their intentions (i.e., movement plans) to move their hand toward two distinct visual targets. Surprisingly, if each identical movement was executed according to a distinct movement plan, participants could readily adapt these movements to two opposing force fields simultaneously. The results demonstrate that multiple motor memories can be learned and flexibly retrieved, even for physically identical movements, according to distinct motor plans in a visual space.",2012,,CURRENT BIOLOGY,22,5,432-436,WOS:000301330200026,10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.042,,#16668,Hirashima 2012,,
Respiratory pathology in vibroacoustic disease: 25 years of research.,"Branco, Nuno A A Castelo; Ferreira, Jose Reis; Alves-Pereira, Mariana","BACKGROUND: Respiratory pathology induced by low frequency noise (LFN, < 500 Hz, including infrasound) is not a novel subject given that in the 1960's, within the context of U.S. and U.S.S.R. Space Programs, other authors have already reported its existence. Within the scope of vibroacoustic disease (VAD), a whole-body pathology caused by excessive exposure to LFN, respiratory pathology takes on specific features. Initially, respiratory pathology was not considered a con- sequence of LFN exposure; but today, LFN can be regarded as a major agent of disease that targets the respiratory system. The goal of this report is to put forth what is known to date on the clinical signs of respiratory pathology seen in VAD patients., METHODS: Data from the past 25 years of research will be taken together and presented., RESULTS: In persons exposed to LFN on the job, respiratory complaints appear af- ter the first 4 years of professional activity. At this stage, they disappear during vacation periods or when the person is removed form his /her workstation for other reasons. With long-term exposure, more serious situations can arise, such as, atypical pleural effusion, respiratory insufficiency, fibrosis and tumours. There is no correlation with smoking habits. In LFN-exposed animal models, morphological changes of the pleura, and loss of the phagocytic ability of pleural mesothelial cells (explaining the atypical pleural effusions). Fibrotic lesions and neo-vascularization were observed along the entire respiratory tract. Fibrosis lesions and neovascularisation were observed through- out the respiratory tract of the animals seen. Pre-malignant lesions, metaplasia e displasia, were also identified., DISCUSSION: LFN is an agent of disease and the respiratory tract is one of its preferential targets.

First published December 2, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00673.2009.-The effects of microgravity on frog semicircular canals have been studied by electrophysiological and morphological approaches. Reduced gravity (microG) was simulated by a random positioning machine (RPM), which continually and randomly modified the orientation in space of the anesthetized animal. As this procedure stimulates the semicircular canals, the effect of altered gravity was isolated by comparing microG-treatment with an identical rotary stimulation in the presence of normal gravity (normoG). Electrophysiological experiments were performed in the isolated labyrinth, extracted from the animals after the treatment, and mounted on a turntable. Junctional activity was measured by recording quantal events (mEPSPs) and spikes from the afferent fibers close to the junction, at rest and during rotational stimulation. MicroG-treated animals displayed a marked decrease in the frequency of resting and evoked mEPSP discharge, vs. both control and normoG (mean decrease similar to 50%). Spike discharge was also depressed: 57% of microG-treated frogs displayed no spikes at rest and during rotation at 0.1 Hz, vs. 23-31% of control or normoG frogs. Among the firing units, during one cycle of sinusoidal rotation at 0.1 Hz microG-treated units emitted an average of 41.8 +/- 8.06 spikes, vs. 77.2 +/- 8.19 in controls. Patch-clamp analysis on dissociated hair cells revealed altered Ca(2+) handling, after microG, consistent with and supportive of the specificity of microG effects.

Biomechanics and energetics of walking in powered ankle exoskeletons using myoelectric control versus mechanically intrinsic control,"Koller, Jeffrey R.; Remy, C. David; Ferris, Daniel P.","Background: Controllers for assistive robotic devices can be divided into two main categories: controllers using neural signals and controllers using mechanically intrinsic signals. Both approaches are prevalent in research devices, but a direct comparison between the two could provide insight into their relative advantages and disadvantages. We studied subjects walking with robotic ankle exoskeletons using two different control modes: dynamic gain proportional myoelectric control based on soleus muscle activity (neural signal), and timing-based mechanically intrinsic control based on gait events (mechanically intrinsic signal). We hypothesized that subjects would have different measures of metabolic work rate between the two controllers as we predicted subjects would use each controller in a unique manner due to one being dependent on muscle recruitment and the other not.Methods: The two controllers had the same average actuation signal as we used the control signals from walking with the myoelectric controller to shape the mechanically intrinsic control signal. The difference being the myoelectric controller allowed step-to-step variation in the actuation signals controlled by the user's soleus muscle recruitment while the timing-based controller had the same actuation signal with each step regardless of muscle recruitment.Results: We observed no statistically significant difference in metabolic work rate between the two controllers. Subjects walked with 11% less soleus activity during mid and late stance and significantly less peak soleus recruitment when using the timing-based controller than when using the myoelectric controller. While walking with the myoelectric controller, subjects walked with significantly higher average positive and negative total ankle power compared to walking with the timing-based controller.Conclusions: We interpret the reduced ankle power and muscle activity with the timing-based controller relative to the myoelectric controller to result from greater slacking effects. Subjects were able to be less engaged on a muscle level when using a controller driven by mechanically intrinsic signals than when using a controller driven by neural signals, but this had no affect on their metabolic work rate. These results suggest that the type of controller (neural vs. mechanical) is likely to affect how individuals use robotic exoskeletons for therapeutic rehabilitation or human performance augmentation.",2018,,JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,15,,,WOS:000433468100001,10.1186/s12984-018-0379-6,,#13882,Koller 2018,,

In this study, a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS)-based unbiased proteomic profiling approach was used to characterize the composition of the hippocampal proteome in adult male Wistar rats exposed to 15 cGy of 1 GeV/n Ti-48 and their sham counterparts. Unique protein signatures were identified in the hippocampal proteome of: (1) sham rats, (2) Ti-exposed rats, (3) Ti-exposed rats that had sham-like spatial memory performance, and (4) Ti-exposed rats that impaired spatial memory performance. Approximately 14% (159) of the proteins detected in hippocampal proteome of sham rats were not detected in the Ti-exposed rats. We explored the possibility that the loss of the Sham-only proteins may arise as a result of SR-induced changes in protein homeostasis.

Development of a mobile robot-based combined sensor platform to determine the correlation between soil penetration resistance and electrical conductivity,"Unal, Ilker; Topakci, Mehmet; Canakci, Murad; Karayel, Davut; Yilmaz, Erdem; Kabas, Onder","Open-field farming involves successive major processes such as preparation of soil, planting the seed, adding pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation, cultivation, and harvest. The main aim of all processes is to achieve maximum yield out of the available agricultural landscape. It is necessary to collect geo-referenced descriptive data on soil characteristics, such as soil penetration resistance and electrical conductivity before starting all these processes. In this context, agricultural robots offer highly promising technologies providing valuable soil data, lower production costs, reduced manual labour, and maximum crop efficiency. The aim of this study is to design and develop a combined sensor platform and a GPS-guided 4WD agricultural autonomous robot to provide rapid measurement and mapping of the soil penetration resistance and the electrical conductivity for precision farming applications. The agricultural robot is a nonholonomic mobile robot, which has a differential steering mechanism and can be forwarded to stable-target points. The combined sensor platform, which is a y-axis shifter driven by a DC motor with reducer, consists of the Wenner array probes and load cell-based penetration rod. AutoCAD software was used for designing and drawing of the robot and measurement platform. All software was coded in Microsoft Visual Basic.NET programming language. Field studies were conducted to measure the soil penetration resistance, electrical conductivity, and determine the correlation between soil penetration resistance and electrical conductivity. As a result, the ranges of the soil measurement were observed between 1.13 MPa-2.14 MPa for penetration resistance and 0.14-0.33 dS/m for electrical conductivity.

Bone formation is not impaired by hibernation (disuse) in black bears <i>Ursus americanus</i>,"Donahue, SW; Vaughan, MR; Demers, LM; Donahue, HJ","Disuse by bed rest, limb immobilization or space flight causes rapid bone loss by arresting bone formation and accelerating bone resorption. This net bone loss increases the risk of fracture upon remobilization. Bone loss also occurs in hibernating ground squirrels, golden hamsters, and little brown bats by arresting bone formation and accelerating bone resorption. There is some histological evidence to suggest that black bears Ursus americanus do not lose bone mass during hibernation (i.e. disuse). There is also evidence suggesting that muscle mass and strength are preserved in black bears during hibernation. The question of whether bears can prevent bone loss during hibernation has not been conclusively answered. The goal of the current study was to further assess bone metabolism in hibernating black bears. Using the same serum markers of bone remodeling used to evaluate human patients with osteoporosis, we assayed serum from five black bears, collected every 10 days over a 196-day period, for bone resorption and formation markers.

The cellular and enzymatic source of the NO, however, remains controversial. In addition, the time course of the endothelial-dependent contribution remains unstudied. We tested the hypotheses that the change in vasoresponsiveness seen in acute (3-day) hindlimb unweighted (HLU) animals is due to an endothelium-dependent mechanism and that endothelial-dependent attenuation in vasoreactivity is due to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS-3) dependent activation. Vasoreactivity was investigated in rat aortic rings following acute HLU treatment. Dose responsiveness to norepinepherine (NE) was depressed after 3-day HLU [1,338 +/- A 54 vs. 2,325 +/- A 58 mg at max (NE), HLU vs. C, P < 0.001]. However, removal of the endothelium restored the vascular contractility to that of C.

Ca+ dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was increased, as was vascular NO products as a result of HLU. While NOS-3 expression was not increased in HLU rats, phosphorylation of NOS-3 at serine-1177 (an activator of NOS-3) was increased while phosphorylation of serine-495 (an inactivator of NOS-3) was decreased. These findings demonstrate that changes in vasoresponsiveness in the acute HLU model of microgravity are due to an upregulation of the endothelial-dependent NO/cGMP pathway through NOS phosphorylation.",2010,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY,110,2,395-404,WOS:000281380800020,10.1007/s00421-010-1514-7,,#16807,White 2010,,
Whole-Body Proton Irradiation Causes Long-Term Damage to Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Mice,"Chang, Jianhui; Feng, Wei; Wang, Yingying; Luo, Yi; Allen, Antino R.; Koturbash, Igor; Turner, Jennifer; Stewart, Blair; Raber, Jacob; Hauer-Jensen, Martin; Zhou, Daohong; Shao, Lijian","Space flight poses certain health risks to astronauts, including exposure to space radiation, with protons accounting for more than 80% of deep-space radiation. Proton radiation is also now being used with increasing frequency in the clinical setting to treat cancer. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to better understand the biological effects of proton radiation on the body. Such improved understanding could also lead to more accurate assessment of the potential health risks of proton radiation, as well as the development of improved strategies to prevent and mitigate its adverse effects. Previous studies have shown that exposure to low doses of protons is detrimental to mature leukocyte populations in peripheral blood, however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. Some of these detriments may be attributable to damage to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that have the ability to self-renew, proliferate and differentiate into different lineages of blood cells through hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The goal of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of low-dose proton irradiation on HSCs. We exposed C57BL/6J mice to 1.0 Gy whole-body proton irradiation (150 MeV) and then studied the effects of proton radiation on HSCs and HPCs in the bone marrow (BM) 22 weeks after the exposure. The results showed that mice exposed to 1.0 Gy whole-body proton irradiation had a significant and persistent reduction of BM HSCs compared to unirradiated controls. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in BM HPCs after proton irradiation. Furthermore, irradiated HSCs and their progeny exhibited a significant impairment in clonogenic function, as revealed by the cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) and colony-forming cell assays, respectively. These long-term effects of proton irradiation on HSCs may be attributable to the induction of chronic oxidative stress in HSCs, because HSCs from irradiated mice exhibited a significant increase in NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, the increased production of ROS in HSCs was associated with a significant reduction in HSC quiescence and an increase in DNA damage. These findings indicate that exposure to proton radiation can lead to long-term HSC injury, probably in part by radiation-induced oxidative stress.

Multi-Target Tracking in Multi-Static Networks with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Using a Robust Multi-Sensor Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Filter,"Zhang, Yuexing; Li, Yiping; Li, Shuo; Zeng, Junbao; Wang, Yiqun; Yan, Shuxue","This paper proposes a centralized MTT method based on a state-of-the-art multi-sensor labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter in underwater multi-static networks with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The LMB filter can accurately extract the number of targets and trajectories from measurements affected by noise, missed detections, false alarms and port-starboard ambiguity. However, its complexity increases as the number of sensors increases. In addition, due to the time-varying underwater environment, AUV detection probabilities are time-varying, and their mismatches often lead to poor MTT performance. Consequently, we detail a robust multi-sensor LMB filter that estimates detection probabilities and multi-target states simultaneously in real time. Moreover, we derive an effective approximate form of the multi-sensor LMB filter using Kullback-Leibler divergence and develop an efficient belief propagation (BP) implementation of the multi-sensor LMB filter. Our method scales linearly with the number of AUVs, providing good scalability and low computational complexity.

Simulated Microgravity Alters P-Glycoprotein Efflux Function and Expression via the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Rat Intestine and Brain,"Liu, Huayan; Liang, Min; Deng, Yulin; Li, Yujuan","The drug efflux transporter permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an important role in oral drug absorption and distribution. Under microgravity (MG), the changes in P-gp efflux function may alter the efficacy of oral drugs or lead to unexpected effects. Oral drugs are currently used to protect and treat multisystem physiological damage caused by MG; whether P-gp efflux function changes under MG remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of P-gp efflux function, expression, and potential signaling pathway in rats and cells under different simulated MG (SMG) duration. The altered P-gp efflux function was verified by the in vivo intestinal perfusion and the brain distribution of P-gp substrate drugs. Results showed that the efflux function of P-gp was inhibited in the 7 and 21 day SMG-treated rat intestine and brain and 72 h SMG-treated human colon adenocarcinoma cells and human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. P-gp protein and gene expression levels were continually down-regulated in rat intestine and up-regulated in rat brain by SMG. P-gp expression was regulated by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway under SMG, verified by a pathway-specific agonist and inhibitor. The elevated intestinal absorption and brain distribution of acetaminophen levels also confirmed the inhibited P-gp efflux function in rat intestine and brain under SMG. This study revealed that SMG alters the efflux function of P-gp and regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the intestine and the brain. These findings may be helpful in guiding the use of P-gp substrate drugs during spaceflight.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,24,6,,WOS:000959852100001,10.3390/ijms24065438,,#16589,Liu 2023,,Animal
Arm locking using laser frequency comb.,"Wu, Hanzhong; Ke, Jun; Wang, Pan-Pan; Tan, Yu-Jie; Luo, Jie; Shao, Cheng-Gang","The space-borne gravitational wave (GW) detectors, e.g., LISA, TaiJi, and TianQin, will open the window in the low-frequency regime (0.1 mHz to 1 Hz) to study the highly energetic cosmic events, such as coalescences and mergers of binary black holes and neutron stars. For the sake of successful observatory of GWs, the required strain sensitivity of the detector is approximately 10-21/Hz1/2 in the science band, 7 orders of magnitude better than the state of the art of the ultra-stable laser. Arm locking is therefore proposed to reduce the laser phase noise by a few orders of magnitude to relax the burden of time delay interferometry. During the past two decades, various schemes have been demonstrated by using single or dual arms between the spacecraft, with consideration of the gain, the nulls in the science band, and the frequency pulling characteristics, etc. In this work, we describe an updated version of single arm locking, and the noise amplification due to the nulls can be flexibly restricted with the help of optical frequency comb. We show that the laser phase noise can be divided by a specific factor with optical frequency comb as the bridge. The analytical results indicate that, the peaks in the science band have been greatly reduced. The performance of the noise suppression shows that the total noise after arm locking can well satisfy the requirement of time delay interferometry, even with the free-running laser source. When the laser source is pre-stabilized to a Fabry-Perot cavity or a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the noise can reach the floor determined by the clock noise, the spacecraft motion, and the shot noise. We also estimate the frequency pulling characteristics of the updated single arm locking, and the results suggest that the pulling rate can be tolerated, without the risk of mode hopping. Arm locking will be a valuable solution for the noise reduction in the space-borne GW detectors. We demonstrate that, with the precise control of the returned laser phase noise, the noise amplification in the science band can be efficiently suppressed based on the updated single arm locking. Not only does our method allow the suppression of the peaks, the high gain, and low pulling rate, it can also serve for full year, without the potential risk of locking failure due to the arm length mismatch. We then discuss the unified demonstration of the updated single arm locking, where both the local and the returned laser phase noises can be tuned to generate the expected arm-locking sensor actually. Finally, the time-series simulations in Simulink have been carried out, and the results indicate a good agreement with the theory, showing that the presented method is reasonable and feasible. Our work could provide a back-up strategy for the arm locking in the future space-borne GW detectors.",2022,/,Optics express,30,5,8027-8048,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.452837,35299553,#418,Wu 2022,,
"Changes in the Surface Expression of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 3, the Induction of Apoptosis, and the Inhibition of Cell-Cycle Progression of Human Multidrug-Resistant Jurkat/A4 Cells Exposed to a Random Positioning Machine.","Sokolovskaya, Alisa; Korneeva, Ekaterina; Zaichenko, Danila; Virus, Edward; Kolesov, Dmitry; Moskovtsev, Aleksey; Kubatiev, Aslan","Experiments from flight- and ground-based model systems suggest that unexpected alterations of the human lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat, as well as effects on cell growth, metabolism, and apoptosis, can occur in altered gravity conditions. Using a desktop random positioning machine (RPM), we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on Jurkat cells and their multidrug-resistant subline, Jurkat/A4 cells. The viability of Jurkat/A4 cells decreased after simulated microgravity in contrast with the Jurkat cells. At the same time, the viability between the experimental Jurkat cells and control Jurkat cells was not significantly different. Of note, Jurkat cells appeared as less susceptible to apoptosis than their multidrug-resistant clone Jurkat/A4 cells, whereas cell-cycle analysis showed that the percentage of Jurkat/A4 cells in the S-phase was increased after 72 and 96 h of RPM-simulated microgravity relative to their static counterparts. The differences in Jurkat cells at all phases between static and simulated microgravity were not significant. The surface expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-also known as cluster of differentiation (CD)50-protein was changed for Jurkat/A4 cells following exposure to the RPM. Changes in cell morphology were observed in the Jurkat/A4 cells after 96 h of RPM-simulated microgravity. Thus, we concluded that Jurkat/A4 cells are more sensitive to RPM-simulated microgravity as compared with the parental Jurkat cell line. We also suggest that intercellular adhesion molecule 3 may be an important adhesion molecule involved in the induction of leukocyte apoptosis.

"Regional climate-driven C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plant variation in the Cheollipo area, Korea, during the late Pleistocene","Lim, Jaesoo; Nahm, Wook-Hyun; Kim, Jin-Kwan; Yang, Dong-Yoon","Marine isotope stage 3 (MIS3), spanning from 25 to 60 ka BP, was a time of substantial environmental change that included changes in the global ice volume and atmospheric composition, with resultant regional climate changes. To understand past vegetation responses to such environmental changes in Korea, we estimated the abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants using the C/N and carbon isotope ratios of sedimentary organic matter. The MIS3 sedimentary unit at the Cheollipo site, located in a western coastal area of Korea, is characterized by a dark to light gray colored sedimentary unit (3.05 to 5.05 m in elevation, MIS3), which is between an underlain oxidized yellowish sedimentary unit (<3.05 m in elevation) and an overlain oxidized yellowish sedimentary unit (>5.05 m in elevation). The estimated abundance of C-4 plants varied between 60 and 10% during the MIS3. The suborbital-scale variation in the estimated percentage of C-4 plants was similar to those reported in continental ice volume and the East Asian monsoon intensity, suggesting that C-4 plants prevailed under colder and drier conditions (intensified winter monsoon), whereas C-3 plants have favored a warmer and wetter climate (intensified summer monsoon). Compared with high latitude regions (e.g., Chinese Loess Plateau and Lake Baikal) where low summer temperature suppressed aridity and pCO(2) influences during the last glacial period, vegetation change in Cheollipo area may have more sensitively responded to aridity change which had been affected by the summer/winter monsoon intensity. The climate change in the western coastal area (Yellow Sea side) of Korea during the late Pleistocene may have been controlled by regional climate change coupled with continental ice volume change.

The focus of our work was to investigate the effect of low-energy proton irradiation on the IgG N-glycosylation profile with the goal if disease associated changes could be detected during space travel and not altered by space radiation. Two ionization sources were used during the experiments, a Van de Graaff generator for the irradiation of solidified hIgG samples in vacuum, and a Tandetron accelerator to irradiate hIgG samples in aqueous solution form. Structural carbohydrate analysis was accomplished by CE with laser induced fluorescent detection to determine the effects of simulated space radiation on N-glycosylation of hIgG1 samples. Our results revealed that even several thousand times higher radiation doses that of astronauts can suffer during long duration missions beyond the shielding environment of Low Earth Orbit, no changes were observed in hIgG1 N-glycosylation.

A pilot project to detect and forecast harmful algal blooms in the northern Gulf of Mexico.,"Fisher, William S; Malone, Thomas C; Giattina, James D","More timely access to data and information on the initiation, evolution and effects of harmful algal blooms can reduce adverse impacts on valued natural resources and human health. To achieve this in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a pilot project was initiated to develop a user-driven, end-to-end (measurements to applications) observing system. A key strategy of the project is to coordinate existing state, federal and academic programs at an unprecedented level of collaboration and partnership. Resource managers charged with protection of public health and aquatic resources require immediate notice of algal events and a forecast of when, where and what adverse effects will likely occur. Further, managers require integrated analyses and interpretations, rather than raw data, to make effective decisions. Consequently, a functional observing system must collect and transform diverse measurements into usable forecasts. Data needed to support development of forecasts will include such properties as sea surface temperature, winds, currents and waves; precipitation and freshwater flows with related discharges of sediment and nutrients; salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll concentrations (in vivo fluorescence); and remotely-sensed spatial images of sea surface chlorophyll concentrations. These data will be provided via a mixture of discrete and autonomous in situ sensing with near real-time data telemetry, and remote sensing from space (SeaWiFS), aircraft (hyperspectral imagery) or land (high-frequency radar).

Adaptive Selective Learning for automatic identification of sub-kilometer craters,"Liu, Siyi; Ding, Wei; Gao, Feng; Stepinski, Tomasz F.","Counting craters is a fundamental task of planetary science, because it provides the only tool for measuring relative ages of planetary surfaces. However, advances in surveying craters present in data gathered by planetary probes have not kept up with advances in data collection. It becomes extremely challenging to automatically count a very large number of small, sub-kilometer size craters in a deluge of high resolution planetary images. In this paper, we combine active learning with semi-supervised learning to build an adaptive learning system to automatically detect craters from high resolution panchromatic planetary images. We propose an Adaptive Selective Algorithm to iteratively enrich an original small training set, using unlabeled test set without additional human labeling effort, to detect craters from a large volume of images. We propose three strategies to improve detection accuracy by integrating classification with exploration on unlabeled samples. The Majority Vote Strategy is used to automatically obtain class labels by exploiting unlabeled samples. The De-Mixed Strategy is used on instance filtering to obtain reliable samples. The Active Stability Strategy is used to obtain an appropriate class distribution in the constructed training set by detecting unstable classes. By using those three strategies, we actively select test instances from test images into an existing small initial training set while rebuilding the classifier in the mean time. Our proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated on a large high resolution Martian image, exhibiting a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by heterogeneous surface morphology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a higher accuracy than other existing approaches to a large extent.

Optical and scanning electron microscopies were used to observe foam morphology. X-ray diffraction spectroscopy was used to study the change in crystallinity with respect to temperature.

Bacterial Growth in Saturated and Eutectic Solutions of Magnesium Sulphate and Potassium Chlorate with Relevance to Mars and the Ocean Worlds.,"Wilks, Jonathan M; Chen, Fei; Clark, Benton C; Schneegurt, Mark A","Liquid water on Mars might be created by deliquescence of hygroscopic salts or by permafrost melts, both potentially forming saturated brines. Freezing point depression allows these heavy brines to remain liquid in the near-surface environment for extended periods, perhaps as eutectic solutions, at the lowest temperatures and highest salt concentrations where ices and precipitates do not form. Perchlorate and chlorate salts and iron sulfate form brines with low eutectic temperatures and may persist under Mars near-surface conditions, but are chemically harsh at high concentrations and were expected to be incompatible with life, while brines of common sulfate salts on Mars may be more suitable for microbial growth. Microbial growth in saturated brines also may be relevant beyond Mars, to the oceans of Ceres, Enceladus, Europa and Pluto. We have previously shown strong growth of salinotolerant bacteria in media containing 2 M MgSO4 heptahydrate (~50% w/v) at 25 degreeC. Here we extend those observations to bacterial isolates from Basque Lake, BC and Hot Lake, WA, that grow well in saturated MgSO4 medium (67%) at 25 degreeC and in 50% MgSO4 medium at 4 degreeC (56% would be saturated). Psychrotolerant, salinotolerant microbes isolated from Basque Lake soils included Halomonas and Marinococcus, which were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and characterized phenetically. Eutectic liquid medium constituted by 43% MgSO4 at -4 degreeC supported copious growth of these psychrotolerant Halomonas isolates, among others. Bacterial isolates also grew well at the eutectic for K chlorate (3% at -3 degreeC).

AUV-Based Side-Scan Sonar Real-Time Method for Underwater-Target Detection,"Tang, Yulin; Wang, Liming; Jin, Shaohua; Zhao, Jianhu; Huang, Chao; Yu, Yongcan","The limitations of underwater acoustic communications mean that the side-scan sonar data of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cannot be transmitted back and processed in real time, which means that targets cannot be detected in real time. To address the problem, this paper proposes an autonomous underwater vehicle-based side-scan sonar real-time detection method for underwater targets. First, the paper describes the system and operation of real-time underwater-target detection by the side-scan sonar mounted on the autonomous underwater vehicle. Next, it proposes a real-time processing method for side-scan sonar data, method for constructing a deep-learning-based underwater-target detection model, and real-time method for underwater-target detection based on navigation strip images, which, together, solve the three key technical problems of real-time data processing, deep-learning-based detection model construction, and real-time target detection based on the autonomous underwater vehicle.

Simulated microgravity inhibits cell focal adhesions leading to reduced melanoma cell proliferation and metastasis <i>via</i> FAK/RhoA-regulated mTORC1 and AMPK pathways,"Tan, Xin; Xu, Aizhang; Zhao, Tuo; Zhao, Qin; Zhang, Jun; Fan, Cuihong; Deng, Yulin; Freywald, Andrew; Genth, Harald; Xiang, Jim","Simulated microgravity (SMG) was reported to affect tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism is elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that clinostat-modelled SMG reduces BL6-10 melanoma cell proliferation, adhesion and invasiveness in vitro and decreases tumor lung metastasis in vivo. It down-regulates metastasis-related integrin alpha 6 beta 4, MMP9 and Met72 molecules. SMG significantly reduces formation of focal adhesions and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho family proteins (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) and of mTORC1 kinase, but activates AMPK and ULK1 kinases. We demonstrate that SMG inhibits NADH induction and glycolysis, but induces mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, administration of a RhoA activator, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF1) effectively converts SMG-triggered alterations and effects on mitochondria biogenesis or glycolysis. CNF1 also converts the SMG-altered cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. In contrast, mTORC inhibitor, rapamycin, produces opposite responses and mimics SMG-induced effects in cells at normal gravity. Taken together, our observations indicate that SMG inhibits focal adhesions, leading to inhibition of signaling FAK and RhoA, and the mTORC1 pathway, which results in activation of the AMPK pathway and reduced melanoma cell proliferation and metastasis.

Sparse representation for infrared Dim target detection via a discriminative over-complete dictionary learned online.,"Li, Zheng-Zhou; Chen, Jing; Hou, Qian; Fu, Hong-Xia; Dai, Zhen; Jin, Gang; Li, Ru-Zhang; Liu, Chang-Ju","It is difficult for structural over-complete dictionaries such as the Gabor function and discriminative over-complete dictionary, which are learned offline and classified manually, to represent natural images with the goal of ideal sparseness and to enhance the difference between background clutter and target signals. This paper proposes an infrared dim target detection approach based on sparse representation on a discriminative over-complete dictionary. An adaptive morphological over-complete dictionary is trained and constructed online according to the content of infrared image by K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm. Then the adaptive morphological over-complete dictionary is divided automatically into a target over-complete dictionary describing target signals, and a background over-complete dictionary embedding background by the criteria that the atoms in the target over-complete dictionary could be decomposed more sparsely based on a Gaussian over-complete dictionary than the one in the background over-complete dictionary. This discriminative over-complete dictionary can not only capture significant features of background clutter and dim targets better than a structural over-complete dictionary, but also strengthens the sparse feature difference between background and target more efficiently than a discriminative over-complete dictionary learned offline and classified manually. The target and background clutter can be sparsely decomposed over their corresponding over-complete dictionaries, yet couldn't be sparsely decomposed based on their opposite over-complete dictionary, so their residuals after reconstruction by the prescribed number of target and background atoms differ very visibly. Some experiments are included and the results show that this proposed approach could not only improve the sparsity more efficiently, but also enhance the performance of small target detection more effectively.",2014,/,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",14,6,9451-70,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s140609451,24871988,#2243,Li 2014,,
Effect of modeled microgravity on radiation-induced adaptive response of root growth in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>,"Deng, Chenguang; Wang, Ting; Wu, Jingjing; Xu, Wei; Li, Huasheng; Liu, Min; Wu, Lijun; Lu, Jinying; Bian, Po","Space particles have an inevitable impact on organisms during space missions; radio-adaptive response (RAR) is a critical radiation effect due to both low-dose background and sudden high-dose radiation exposure during solar storms. Although it is relevant to consider RAR within the context of microgravity, another major space environmental factor, there is no existing evidence as to its effects on RAR. In the present study, we established an experimental method for detecting the effects of gamma-irradiation on the primary root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, in which RAR of root growth was significantly induced by several dose combinations. Microgravity was simulated using a two-dimensional rotation clinostat. It was shown that RAR of root growth was significantly inhibited under the modeled microgravity condition, and was absent in pgm-1 plants that had impaired gravity sensing in root tips. These results suggest that RAR could be modulated in microgravity. Time course analysis showed that microgravity affected either the development of radio-resistance induced by priming irradiation, or the responses of plants to challenging irradiation. After treatment with the modeled microgravity, attenuation in priming irradiation-induced expressions of DNA repair genes (AtKu70 and AtRAD54), and reduced DNA repair efficiency in response to challenging irradiation were observed. In plant roots, the polar transportation of the phytohormone auxin is regulated by gravity, and treatment with an exogenous auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) prevented the induction of RAR of root growth, suggesting that auxin might play a regulatory role in the interaction between microgravity and RAR of root growth.

Cooling to Facilitate Metabolic Suppression in Healthy Individuals,"Rittenberger, Jon C.; Flickinger, Kathryn L.; Weissman, Alexandra; Repine, Melissa; Elmer, Jonathan; Guyette, Francis X.; Callaway, Clifton W.","BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide (CO2) toxicity could be catastrophic for astronauts. Suppressing metabolism by lowering body temperature decreases CO2 production and may facilitate rescue in the event of a crippled ship. Lowering body temperature requires shivering suppression. We evaluated dexmedetomidine to facilitate cooling of healthy individuals.METHODS: Following consent, we administered a 1 mcg.kg(-1) bolus of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous infusion (0.5-1.4 mcg . kg(-1). h(-1)) for 3 h of cooling. We cooled subjects using a bolus of 30 cc . kg(-1) of 4 degrees C saline followed by surface cooling. We measured vital signs, thermal and comfort scales, sedation, and shivering for 3 h and during recovery. ANOVA evaluated changes in measures over time.RESULTS: Nine subjects completed the study. Mean age was 31 (SD 8) yr, mean mass was 71 (SD 14) kg, height of 168 (SD 9) cm, and body mass index of 25 (SD 3). Median time to 1 degrees C drop in core temperature was 16 (IQR 15, 32) min. Temperature changed over time with median lowest temperature being 33.1 degrees C (IQR 32.8 degrees C, 34.1 degrees C). Neither heart rate nor diastolic blood pressures changed over time. Systolic blood pressure decreased over time. Subjects responded to verbal stimuli and completed tasks throughout the protocol. During cooling and maintenance, subjects reported discomfort and the sensation of being cold.CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine facilitates shivering suppression during prolonged cooling in healthy individuals.

Evidence of avian-mediated long distance dispersal in American tardigrades.,"Mogle, Matthew J; Kimball, Scott A; Miller, William R; McKown, Richard D","Terrestrial tardigrades, commonly known as ""water bears"", are part of a phylum of microscopic, aquatic invertebrates famous for cryptobiosis and space travel, but little is known about their modes of dispersal on Earth. Wind is assumed, but not truly demonstrated, to be the major method of global dispersal. Yet, some water bear distribution patterns cannot be explained by patterns of prevailing winds. Mammals and birds have been proposed as potential animal vectors. Importantly, most nearctic-neotropical migrant birds move north and south, with many crossing the equator, whereas prevailing winds move west to east or east to west but do not cross the equator. When multiplied by billions of birds over tens of millions of years, if the ectozoochory of tardigrades by birds is true then both regional and intercontinental patterns can be better explained. To test for the potential role of birds in tardigrade dispersal, the nests of 10 species for birds were examined. Seventy percent of nests were positive for tardigrades, demonstrating that some birds are in a position for transference. The carcasses of eight birds (six species) found dead from window strikes and a Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis) found dead during routine surveys were also examined. Of the birds examined, 66% yielded tardigrades from two classes, three orders, and five species, including juveniles, adults, and eggs, suggesting that many bird species are potential vectors for many species of tardigrades. Our data support the hypothesis of avian-mediated long distance dispersal of tardigrades and provide evidence that further investigation is warranted.",2018,/,PeerJ,6,101603425,e5035,,https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5035,30018851,#1869,Mogle 2018,,

Response of the mouse sublingual gland to spaceflight.,"Dagdeviren, Didem; Beallias, John; Khan, Izaz; Mednieks, Maija I.; Hand, Arthur R.","The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery [Space Transportation System (STS)‐131] and Atlantis (STS‐135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground (control) and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS‐131 flight mice was significantly increased compared with ground (control) mice but decreased in STS‐135 flight mice. Similarly, expression of mucin (MUC‐19) in acinar cells and expression of the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA‐RII) in demilune cells were increased in STS‐131 flight mice and decreased in STS‐135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA‐RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types, and secretory proteins.

"Development of an OspC-based tetravalent, recombinant, chimeric vaccinogen that elicits bactericidal antibody against diverse Lyme disease spirochete strains","Earnhart, Christopher G.; Buckles, Eric L.; Marconi, Richard T.","Lyme disease is the most common arthropod-borne disease in North America and Europe. At present, there is no commercially available vaccine for use in humans. Outer surface protein C (OspC) has antigenic and expression characteristics that make it an attractive vaccine candidate; however, sequence heterogeneity has impeded its use as a vaccinogen. Sequence analyses have identified 21 well defined OspC phyletic groups or ""types"" (designated A-U). In this report we have mapped the linear epitopes presented by OspC types B, K, and D during human and murine infection and exploited these epitopes (along with the previously identified type A OspC linear epitopes) in the development of a recombinant, tetravalent, chimeric vaccinogen. The construct was found to be highly immunogenic in mice and the induced antibodies surface labeled in vitro cultivated spirochetes. Importantly, vaccination induced complement-dependent bactericidal antibodies against strains expressing each of the OspC types that were incorporated into the construct.

Recently we demonstrated that a simulated microgravity is conducive for maintaining long-term cultures of functional hepatocytes and promote 3D cell assembly. Using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray technology, it is now possible to measure the levels of thousands of different messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) in a single hybridization step. This technique is particularly powerful for comparing gene expression in the same tissue under different environmental conditions. The aim of this research was to analyze gene expression of hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) during early stage of 3D-cell assembly in simulated microgravity. For this, mRNA from HepG2 cultured in the RCCS was analyzed by deoxyribonucleic acid microarray. Analyses of HepG2 mRNA by using 6K glass DNA microarray revealed changes in expression of 95 genes (overexpression of 85 genes and downregulation of 10 genes).

Design of an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network sliding mode robust controller for higher stability of magnetic spacecraft attitude control.,"Liu, Xuan; Zhao, Taoyan; Cao, Jiangtao; Li, Ping","This paper designs an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network sliding mode robust controller (IT2FNNSMRC) to improve the stability of the vibrational angle of the orbital plane in magnetic rigid spacecraft attitude control. The control system consists of an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) controller, a PD controller, and a robust controller in parallel connection. The IT2FNN controller, as a nonlinear regulator, compensates the nonlinearity of the controlled object; the PD controller, as a feedback controller, ensures the global asymptotic stability of the control system; the robust controller inhibits input load disturbance. The IT2FNN controller hereof has a self-organizing function which enables it to automatically determine the network structure and parameters online. At the stage of IT2FNN structure learning, the standard on rule growth is set according to the incentive intensities of IT2FNN rule premises. A new rule is generated when the incentive intensities of rules are all smaller than a certain threshold; next, a significance index is set for each rule. When the significance index of some rule decays to a certain threshold, the corresponding rule shall be deleted to achieve the goals of optimizing IT2FNN structure and reducing system complexity. At the stage of parameter learning, adaptive adjustment of IT2FNN parameters is made via the sliding mode control theory learning algorithm, and the stabilities of the algorithm and control system are proven using Lyapunov function. Finally, the proposed control scheme is used in the control of a magnetic rigid spacecraft, as compared to three other designed control methods. Simulation results show that IT2FNNSMRC has superior control precision and stability. And the IT2FNN which adopts the proposed learning algorithm can address uncertainty satisfactorily, with higher computational implementability. Copyright © 2023 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"A novel, population-based approach to astronaut radiation risk assessment","Pal Chowdhury, R.; Stoffle, N.N.; Rios, R.R.; Stegeman, L.A.; Bahadori, A.A.","Risk due to space radiation exposure is one of the prime concerns for astronaut health and safety on deep space missions. NASA's current radiation risk limit is 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID) at the upper 95% tolerance limit. Sex and age dependence in existing radiation risk models and large uncertainties, mostly due to lack of knowledge of biological effects of highly energetic and heavy charged particles, presently limit demographics to older, male astronauts for participation in long-duration missions to Mars. To address this issue, a novel method is introduced for evaluating radiation risk for proposed missions, where the combined risk for the population is used in place of age- and sex-specific risks. The age and sex distribution of active and trainee astronauts as of 2018 and operational NASA tools for evaluating astronaut radiation risk are used to demonstrate the proposed method for a variety of missions. Discrete and continuous methods representing the population probability density function are tested. Mission-specific astronaut population risk distributions are constructed using random sampling from the astronaut age and sex distributions, which are then used to calculate the corresponding upper 95% tolerance limit. It is found that the population-combined REID for a conjunction class Mars mission in solar maximum conditions is around 4% at upper 95% tolerance limit, which is less than the REID for female astronauts of age less than 55 years. It is also found that the probability density function and organ-specific risks for the population-combined REID are very close to that of 30-year-old male and 60-year-old female astronauts.

In nature, many lichens tolerate extreme environmental conditions and thus became valuable models in astrobiological research to fathom biological resistance towards non-terrestrial conditions; including space exposure, hypervelocity impact simulations as well as space and Martian parameter simulations. All studies demonstrated the high resistance towards non-terrestrial abiotic factors of selected extremotolerant lichens. Besides other adaptations, this study focuses on the morphological and anatomical traits by comparing five lichen species-Circinaria gyrosa, Rhizocarpon geographicum, Xanthoria elegans, Buellia frigida, Pleopsidium chlorophanum-used in present-day astrobiological research. Detailed investigation of thallus organization by microscopy methods allows to study the effect of morphology on lichen resistance and forms a basis for interpreting data of recent and future experiments. All investigated lichens reveal a common heteromerous thallus structure but diverging sets of morphological-anatomical traits, as intra-/extra-thalline mucilage matrices, cortices, algal arrangements, and hyphal strands. In B. frigida, R. geographicum, and X. elegans the combination of pigmented cortex, algal arrangement, and mucilage seems to enhance resistance, while subcortex and algal clustering seem to be crucial in C. gyrosa, as well as pigmented cortices and basal thallus protrusions in P. chlorophanum. Thus, generalizations on morphologically conferred resistance have to be avoided. Such differences might reflect the diverging evolutionary histories and are advantageous by adapting lichens to prevalent abiotic stressors.

Microgravity laser-photophoresis of high density microparticles in water,"Tamagawa, M.; Monjushiro, H.; Watarai, H.","Laser-photophoresis is a new technique, which can be used to characterize and separate microparticles in liquids. The photophoretic migration of high density solid particles in water has been observed experimentally for the first time by experiments under microgravity conditions. The photophoretic velocity was measured under microgravity conditions, in order to minimize the effects of density difference and convection. Furthermore, by using an optical cylindrical cell, we could observe the precise photophoretic velocities without the wall-induced drag effect. The apparatus consisted of a cw Nd:YAG laser (532 nm), a microscope, a CCD system, and a remote controlled sample stage and was set in a capsule which was used for a free-fall experiment. All the experimental operations were made externally by using a personal computer. The photophoretic velocities for the particles of carbon, stainless steel, gold plated nickel, and polystyrene in water were determined under microgravity. It was found that the photophoretic efficiencies of the photo-absorbing carbon particles and the photo-reflecting metal particles were much larger than those of transparent particles. The order of magnitude of the observed photophoretic efficiency was carbon>stainless steel>gold plated nickel>polystyrene. The photophoretic efficiencies were compared with those calculated by a Mie scattering theory. It was proved that the Mie scattering theory was useful for the prediction of the photophoretic efficiency of various kinds of particles in water. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Determination of Chromosome Aberrations in Human Fibroblasts Irradiated by Mixed Fields Generated with Shielding,"Slaba, T.C.; Plante, I.; Ponomarev, A.; Patel, Z.S.; Hada, M.","To better study biological effects of space radiation using ground-based facilities, the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory has been upgraded to rapidly switch ions and energies. This has allowed investigators to design irradiation protocols comprising a mixture of ions and energies more indicative of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment. Despite these advancements, beam selection and delivery schemes should be optimized against facility and experimental constraints and validated to ensure such irradiations are a suitable representation of the space environment. Importantly, since experiments are time consuming and expensive, models capable of predicting biological outcomes over a range of irradiation conditions (single ion, sequential multi ion or mixed fields) are needed to support such efforts. In this work, human fibroblasts were placed behind 20 g/cm2 aluminum and 10.345 g/cm2 polyethylene and irradiated separately by 344 MeV hydrogen, 344 MeV/n helium, 450 MeV/n oxygen and 950 MeV/n iron ions at various doses. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome painting technique was then used to assess the cells for chromosome aberrations (CAs), notably simple exchanges. A multi-scale modeling approach was also developed to predict the formation of chromosome aberrations in these experiments. The Geant4 simulation toolkit was used to determine the spectra of particles and energies produced by interactions between the incident beams and shielding. The simulated mixed field generated by shielding was then transferred into the track structure code, RITRACKS (relativistic ion tracks), to generate three-dimensional (3D) voxelized dose maps at the nanometer scale. Finally, these voxel dose maps were input into the new damage and repair model, RITCARD (radiation-induced tracks, chromosome aberrations, repair and damage), to predict the formation of various CAs. The multi-scale model described herein is a significant advancement for the computational tools used to predict biological outcomes in cells exposed to highly complex, mixed ion fields related to the GCR environment. Results show that the simulation and experimental data are in good agreement for the complex radiation fields generated by all ions incident on shielding for most data points. The differences between model predictions and measurements are discussed. Although improvements are needed, the model extends current capabilities for evaluating beam selection and delivery schemes at the NSRL ground-based GCR simulator and for informing NASA risk projection models in the future.",2020,,Radiation Research,194,3,246-258,,10.1667/RR15366.1,,#4690,Slaba 2020,,
Human-Inspired Control of Dual-Arm Exoskeleton Robots With Force and Impedance Adaptation,"Li, Zhijun; Xu, Cuichao; Wei, Qiang; Shi, Chao; Su, Chun-Yi","Humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. Traditional robots perform tasks independently without considering their interactions with the external environment, which leads to poor flexibility and adaptability. Comparatively, humans can adapt to complex environments by voluntarily adjusting the impedance parameters and interaction force. In order to solve the problems of human-robot security and adaptability to unknown environment, a human-inspired control with force and impedance adaptation is proposed to interact with unknown environments and exhibit this biological behavior on the developed dual-arm exoskeleton robots. First, we propose a computationally model utilizing the sampled surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals to calculate the human arm endpoint stiffness and define a co-contraction index to describe the dynamic behaviors of the muscular activities in the tasks. Then, the obtained human limb impedance stiffness parameters and the sampling position information are transferred to the slave arm of the exoskeleton as the input variables of the controller in real-time. In addition, a variable stiffness observer is used here to compensate for the errors of the calculated stiffness by sEMG signals. The experimental studies of human impedance transfer control have been conducted to show the effectiveness of the developed approach. Results of the experimental suggest that the proposed controller can achieve human motor adaptation and enable the subjects to execute a skill transfer control by a dual-arm exoskeleton robot.",2020,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS,50,12,5296-5305,WOS:000591832800038,10.1109/TSMC.2018.2871196,,#11394,Li 2020,,
Microgravity mediated changes in phytoferritin accumulation in soybean root cap cells.,"Klymchuk, D O; Kordyum, E L; Vorobyova, T V; Brown, C S; Chapman, D K","Phytoferritin is an iron-protein complex analogous to the ferritin found in mammalian, bacteria and fungi cells. Phytoferritin molecules are large proteins, about 10.5 nm in diameter, visualised in an electron microscope as discrete, electron dense particles with iron-containing core, where several thousand atoms of iron lie within the proteinaceous shell (apoferritin). In higher plants, a plastid stroma is the site of phytoferritin storage. Phytoferritin is seen in all types of plastids. It is considered to be a mechanism used by cells to store iron in a non-toxic form. Phytoferritin-bound iron may subsequently be used to form iron-containing components. It was shown that low levels of phytoferritin are synthesised in normal green leaves, whereas chlorotic leaves do not have a measurable amount of phytoferritin and leaves of iron-loaded seedlings contain a high level of total iron, and phytoferritin well-filled by iron. Phytoferritin accumulation was observed in photosynthetic inactivity chloroplasts during senescence and disease.

A Novel Technique for High-Precision Ionospheric VTEC Estimation and Prediction at the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly Region: A Case Study over Haikou Station,"Wang, Hai-Ning; Zhu, Qing-Lin; Dong, Xiang; Sheng, Dong-Sheng; Zhi, Yong-Feng; Zhou, Chen; Xu, Bin","This paper introduces a novel technique that uses observation data from GNSS to estimate the ionospheric vertical total electron content (VTEC) using the Kriging-Kalman method. The technique provides a method to validate the accuracy of the Ionospheric VTEC analysis within the Equatorial Ionization anomaly region. The technique developed uses GNSS VTEC alongside solar parameters, such as solar radio flux (F10.7 cm), Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) and other data, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to predict the occurrence time of the ionospheric equatorial anomaly and ionospheric VTEC changes. The LSTM method was applied to GNSS data from Haikou Station. A comparison of this technique with the neural network (NN) model and International Reference Ionosphere model shows that the LSTM outperforms all of them at VTEC estimation and prediction. The results, which are based on the root mean square error (RMSE) between GNSS VTEC and GIM VTEC outside the equatorial anomaly region, was 1.42 TECU, and the results of GNSS VTEC and VTEC from Beidou geostationary orbit satellite, which lies inside the equatorial ionization anomaly region, was 1.92 TECU.

Increased diversification rates are coupled with higher rates of climate space exploration in Australian <i>Acacia</i> (Caesalpinioideae),"Renner, Matt A. M.; Foster, Charles S. P.; Miller, Joseph T.; Murphy, Daniel J.","Australia is an excellent setting to explore relationships between climate change and diversification dynamics. Aridification since the Eocene has resulted in spectacular radiations within one or more Australian biomes. Acacia is the largest plant genus on the Australian continent, with around 1000 species, and is present in all biomes. We investigated the macroevolutionary dynamics of Acacia within climate space. We analysed phylogenetic and climatic data for 503 Acacia species to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny and central climatic tendencies for BioClim layers from 132 000 herbarium specimens. Diversification rate heterogeneity and rates of climate space exploration were tested. We inferred two diversification rate increases, both associated with significantly higher rates of climate space exploration. Observed spikes in climate disparity within the Pleistocene correspond with onset of Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycling. Positive time dependency in environmental disparity applies in the basal grade of Acacia, though climate space exploration rates were lower. Incongruence between rates of climate space exploration and disparity suggests different Acacia lineages have experienced different macroevolutionary processes. The second diversification rate increase is associated with a south-east Australian mesic lineage, suggesting adaptations to progressively aridifying environments and ability to transition into mesic environments contributed to Acacia's dominance across Australia.",2020,,NEW PHYTOLOGIST,226,2,609-622,WOS:000507612200001,10.1111/nph.16349,,#12766,Renner 2020,,

In particular, by focusing the analysis on the direct and inverse correlation of the frontal PSD theta (4 - 7 (Hz)) and HR, and of the parietal PSD alpha (10-12 (Hz)) and EBR, respectively, with the degree of mental and emotive engagement, it is possible to obtain useful information about the training improvement across the training sessions.",2014,,2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC),,,3005-3008,WOS:000350044702246,,,#12860,IEEE 2014,,

Through the various mechanochemical or physical mechanisms, we show how molecular motion can be collectively amplified into versatile macroscopic deformation by materials engineering across multiple length scales. In controlled ways, mobile micromachines are made to crawl, roll or jump and adaptive to various terrains, typically inspired by the terrestrial animals while propulsion of swimming micromachines are guided by aquatic organisms. Besides, outof-equilibrium behaviors of living systems, such as cell cycling, have stimulated the design of autonomous movement.

Leaving the protection that Low Earth Orbit provides will unavoidably expose astronauts to higher cumulative doses of space radiation, in addition to other stressors, e.g., microgravity. Immune regulation is known to be impacted by both radiation and spaceflight and it remains to be seen whether prolonged effects that will be encountered in deep space can have an adverse impact on health. In this study, we investigated the effects in the overall metabolism of three different low dose radiation exposures (gamma-rays, O-16, and Fe-56) in spleens from male C57BL/6 mice at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure. Forty metabolites were identified with significant enrichment in purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the gamma irradiated samples, while later responses shifted towards more prominent responses in groups with high energy particle irradiations. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation of the abundance of identified fatty acids with time and a negative association with gamma-rays, while the degradation pathway of purines was positively associated with time.

A brief overview of modern directions in marine DOC studies part II--recent progress in marine DOC studies.,"Dafne-, Evgeny V; Wangersky, Peter J","Progress made in analytical techniques allows the formulation of new concepts in the biogeochemistry of organic carbon. The second part of our review summarizes the latest evolution and introduces new ideas in the biogeochemistry of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Via classification of different fractions and sources of DOC, characterization of its composition, age and availability for bacterial utilization, and fate of DOC, we show the role of DOC in the global carbon cycle and the significance of bulk DOC in the oceans. Special emphasis is placed on the microbial loop in the cycling of DOC and its relation with higher trophic levels (phytoplankton and zooplankton). Significant progress has also been made in the study of the roles of colloidal organic material in metal complexation, ultraviolet radiation in dissolved organic matter photochemical oxidation, and chromophore-containing constituents of DOC as the signature of DOC for satellite observations. The importance of bulk DOC in the global carbon cycle requires the inclusion of this fraction in the regional and global carbon models. We predict that future DOC study in the ocean will focus on the development of sophisticated, almost continuously recording, moored DOC instrument arrays for the monitoring of small-scale DOC horizontal and vertical patchiness; widespread time series stations including estuarine, coastal and open environments; more detailed chemical characterization of different fractions of organic carbon from diverse marine habitats; parameterization of predictive models of DOC cycling on regional and global scales, incorporating the microbial loop; and finally, monitoring of DOC dynamics from satellites on regional and global scales.",2002,/,Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM,4,1,55-69,,,11871710,#3596,Dafne- 2002,,
Changes in Higher-Order Chromosomal Structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae Under Simulated Microgravity.,"Wang, Yahao; Shen, Wenlong; Yin, Man; Huang, Wenhua; Ye, Bingyu; Li, Ping; Shi, Shu; Bai, Ge; Guo, Xinjie; Jin, Yifei; Lin, Kailin; Zhang, Yan; Jiang, Yongqiang; Wang, Junfeng; Han, Yanping; Zhao, Zhihu","Our previous work have shown that certain subpopulations of Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibit significant phenotypic changes under simulated microgravity (SMG), including enhanced biofilm formation and cellulose synthesis, which may be evoked by changes in gene expression patterns. It is well known that prokaryotic cells genomic DNA can be hierarchically organized into different higher-order three-dimensional structures, which can highly influence gene expression. It is remain elusive whether phenotypic changes induced by SMG in the subpopulations of K. pneumoniae are driven by genome higher-order structural changes. Here, we investigated the above-mentioned issue using the wild-type (WT) K. pneumoniae (WT was used as a control strain and continuously cultivated for 2 weeks under standard culture conditions of normal gravity) and two previous identified subpopulations (M1 and M2) obtained after 2 weeks of continuous incubation in a SMG device. By the combination of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA-seq and whole-genome methylation (WGS) analyses, we found that the along with the global chromosome interactions change, the compacting extent of M1, M2 subpopulations were much looser under SMG and even with an increase in active, open chromosome regions. In addition, transcriptome data showed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, whereas a few DEGs were downregulated in M1 and M2. The functions of both types DEGs were mainly associated with membrane fractions. Additionally, WGS analysis revealed that methylation levels were lower in M1 and M2. Using combined analysis of multi-omics data, we discovered that most upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the boundary regions of the variable chromosomal interaction domains (CIDs), in which genes regulating biofilm formation were mainly located. These results suggest that K. pneumoniae may regulate gene expression patterns through DNA methylation and changes in genome structure, thus resulting in new phenotypes in response to altered gravity.

Iron flux inside the International Space Station is measured to be lower than predicted,"Narici, L.; Casolino, M.; Di Fino, L.; Larosa, M.; Larsson, O.; Picozza, P.; Zaconte, V.","Iron abundance in cosmic rays impinging on astronauts in space habitats is of paramount importance when calculating the radiation risk for human space exploration. The concurrent high relative abundance of iron in Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and iron ability to produce damages at cellular and molecular levels, together with recent radiobiology results suggests iron as a major candidate to be studied in order to produce accurate radiation hazard assessments. Iron may be in fact responsible for a large percentage of cancer risk during a long interplanetary voyage, and therefore deserves a specific attention. We built a simple model based on CREME96 for the radiation in the International Space Station (ISS) and tested it against recently performed measurements with the ALTEA and Alteino particle detectors. While we can report a good agreement between 50m and 250 keV/mu m (very good for several peaks such as Si, Mg, S) we show an overestimation by this model of iron abundances of about 25-80% when compared to the measurements. New analysis on previously published work, supporting this result, are also reported.Reasons for this overestimation are discussed, they are likely to be related to the not detailed enough transport through the multiplicity of the ISS shielding and to the often used simplification of ""aluminum equivalent shielding"". The iron sources in LEO, possibly not yet accurate enough when transported in Low Earth Orbit, can also play a role.

Understanding the efficacy behind Pharmacological Countermeasures (PCMs) and deliverable pharmacy services is imperative for the future presence of humans in space. However, while the pharmacist plays an integral role for human health terrestrially, pharmacist input has been minimal for human health in the space sector. Here, we explore the pharmacist's potential role in larger medical teams for future missions., OBJECTIVE: To explore pharmacy and space sector stakeholder perspectives regarding the pharmacist's role in the space sector., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with pharmacy (n = 31) and human health-related space sector stakeholders (n = 26) across the globe from governmental, commercial, industry and academic sectors. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to identify stakeholders. Interviews and focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed., RESULTS: Three themes - medication management, medication-related research and medication and health information - were generated. The importance of medication optimisation within commercial and federal spaceflight participant medication regimens was cited as necessary for sustainable space exploration. Both groups advocated for pharmacists' involvement with in-situ medication manufacturing and medication-related research, particularly regarding space-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug profiling. Other essential roles included the pharmacist's role in providing medication information to spaceflight participants and other healthcare professionals on their health status and medication use risk in the context of space., CONCLUSIONS: With the advancement of accessible, commercial space travel and humans becoming an inter-planetary species, the opportunity to tackle PCM needs via a more extensive and comprehensive collaborative effort between the space, medical and pharmacy sectors is essential for sustainable space exploration.

Multisource Fusion UAV Cluster Cooperative Positioning Using Information Geometry,"Tang, Chengkai; Wang, Yuyang; Zhang, Lingling; Zhang, Yi; Song, Houbing","Due to the functional limitations of a single UAV, UAV clusters have become an important part of smart cities, and the relative positioning between UAVs is the core difficulty in UAV cluster applications. Existing UAVs can be equipped with satellite navigation, radio navigation, and other positioning equipment, but in complex environments, such as urban canyons, various navigation sources cannot achieve full positioning information due to occlusion, interference, and other factors, and existing positioning fusion methods cannot meet the requirements of these environments. Therefore, demand exists for the real-time positioning of UAV clusters. Aiming to solve the above problems, this paper proposes multisource fusion UAV cluster cooperative positioning using information geometry (UCP-IG), which converts various types of navigation source information into information geometric probability models and reduces the impact of accidental errors, and proposes the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization (KLM) fusion method to achieve rapid fusion on geometric manifolds and creatively solve the problem of difficult fusion caused by different positioning information formats and parameters. The method proposed in this paper is compared with the main synergistic methods, such as LS and neural networks, in an ideal scenario, a mutation error scenario, and a random motion scenario.

A second life in science--working after the age of 65.,"Setlow, Richard B","I was born in January, 1921 and was fortunate in working for a research organization that had no fixed retirement age. I was permitted to continue Science as long as there were some resources to support research that had some relevance to the organization's goals. A number of projects on which I worked were continuations of ones begun before the age of 65 (1986) and several new ones were based on both previous interests and ideas and some on new ideas. A number of the ideas arose from participation on Committees of the US National Research Council. I was able to extend my earlier interests in DNA repair to include experiments on the variations in DNA repair among apparently normal humans. In collaborations with other researchers we showed that the repair abilities following exposures to chemicals or to ionizing or ultraviolet (UV) radiation did not follow Poisson distributions. I participated in experiments, using a fish model to estimate the wavelength ranges in sunlight responsible for inducing melanoma and another fish model to estimate the germ cell mutations that might arise from exposures to the heavily ionizing particles in cosmic rays beyond low Earth orbit.

Enabling Clonal Analyses of Yeast in Outer Space by Encapsulation and Desiccation in Hollow Microparticles.,"Ng, Simon; Williamson, Cayden; van Zee, Mark; Di Carlo, Dino; Santa Maria, Sergio R","Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.",2022,/,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",12,8,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life12081168,36013347,#358,Ng 2022,,
"Regulation of Bone by Mechanical Loading, Sex Hormones, and Nerves: Integration of Such Regulatory Complexity and Implications for Bone Loss during Space Flight and Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis","Hart, D.A.","During evolution, the development of bone was critical for many species to thrive and function in the boundary conditions of Earth. Furthermore, bone also became a storehouse for calcium that could be mobilized for reproductive purposes in mammals and other species. The critical nature of bone for both function and reproductive needs during evolution in the context of the boundary conditions of Earth has led to complex regulatory mechanisms that require integration for optimization of this tissue across the lifespan. Three important regulatory variables include mechanical loading, sex hormones, and innervation/neuroregulation. The importance of mechanical loading has been the target of much research as bone appears to subscribe to the “use it or lose it” paradigm. Furthermore, because of the importance of post-menopausal osteoporosis in the risk for fractures and loss of function, this aspect of bone regulation has also focused research on sex differences in bone regulation. The advent of space flight and exposure to microgravity has also led to renewed interest in this unique environment, which could not have been anticipated by evolution, to expose new insights into bone regulation. Finally, a body of evidence has also emerged indicating that the neuroregulation of bone is also central to maintaining function. However, there is still more that is needed to understand regarding how such variables are integrated across the lifespan to maintain function, particularly in a species that walks upright. This review will attempt to discuss these regulatory elements for bone integrity and propose how further study is needed to delineate the details to better understand how to improve treatments for those at risk for loss of bone integrity, such as in the post-menopausal state or during prolonged space flight.",2023,,Biomolecules,13,7,,,10.3390/biom13071136,,#3870,Hart 2023,,
A review on the application of autonomous and intelligent robotic devices in medical rehabilitation,"Garcia-Gonzalez, Alejandro; Fuentes-Aguilar, Rita Q.; Salgado, Ivan; Chairez, Isaac","Robot-assisted rehabilitation is an exciting field which aims to incorporate relevant developments in robotics related to rehabilitation with the intention of defining new methodologies for intervening problems related to muscular, neuromuscular, and osseous diseases. In this study, a systematic and comprehensive literature analysis is conducted to identify the contribution of artificial intelligence applied on robotic devices for motor rehabilitation, highlighting its relation with the rehabilitation cycle, and clarifying the prospective research directions in the development of more autonomous rehabilitation procedures. Considering this main goal, a summarized definition of general rehabilitation techniques is established. Then, such definition is particularized for technological-aided rehabilitating medical treatments implementing artificial intelligence methods, identifying the sections included within the process and the associated interaction degrees. This generic definition is analyzed using the current literature in muscle-skeletal treatment robotics as reference framework. This analysis considers the components and sections included in rehabilitation sequence. This review also describes a more in-depth description of the principal categories for classifying therapeutic robotic devices, including descriptions of the main past and present outcomes for each class of medical robotics for rehabilitation. The existing challenges and open options to develop more efficient autonomous (with the application of diverse artificial intelligence approaches) rehabilitating procedures are discoursed. Besides, taking into account this comprehensive review, a sequence of technical requires which must be taken into consideration when designing, developing and implementing autonomous robotic devices aimed to contribute to rehabilitation medical systems are deliberated.

Characterization of the survival ability of Cupriavidus metallidurans and Ralstonia pickettii from space-related environments.,"Mijnendonckx, K; Provoost, A; Ott, C M; Venkateswaran, K; Mahillon, J; Leys, N; Van Houdt, R","Four Cupriavidus metallidurans and eight Ralstonia pickettii isolates from the space industry and the International Space Station (ISS) were characterized in detail. Nine of the 12 isolates were able to form a biofilm on plastics and all were resistant to several antibiotics. R. pickettii isolates from the surface of the Mars Orbiter prior to flight were 2.5 times more resistant to UV-C(254nm) radiation compared to the R. pickettii type strain. All isolates showed moderate to high tolerance against at least seven different metal ions. They were tolerant to medium to high silver concentrations (0.5-4 muM), which are higher than the ionic silver disinfectant concentrations measured regularly in the drinking water aboard the ISS. Furthermore, all isolates survived a 23-month exposure to 2 muM AgNO(3) in drinking water. These resistance properties are putatively encoded by their endogenous megaplasmids. This study demonstrated that extreme resistance is not required to withstand the disinfection and sterilization procedures implemented in the ISS and space industry.

"A novel population balance model to investigate the kinetics of in vitro cell proliferation: part II. Numerical solution, parameters' determination, and model outcomes.","Fadda, Sarah; Cincotti, Alberto; Cao, Giacomo","Based on the general theoretical model developed in Part I of this work, a series of numerical simulations related to the in vitro proliferation kinetics of adherent cells is here presented. First the complex task of assigning a specific value to all the parameters of the proposed population balance (PB) model is addressed, by also highlighting the difficulties arising when performing proper comparisons with experimental data. Then, a parametric sensitivity analysis is performed, thus identifying the more relevant parameters from a kinetics perspective. The proposed PB model can be adapted to describe cell growth under various conditions, by properly changing the value of the adjustable parameters. For this reason, model parameters able to mimic cell culture behavior under microgravity conditions are identified by means of a suitable parametric sensitivity analysis. Specifically, it is found that, as the volume growth parameter is reduced, proliferation slows down while cells arrest in G0/G1 or G2/M depending on the initial distribution of cell population. On the basis of this result, model capabilities have been tested by means of a proper comparison with literature experimental data related to the behavior of synchronized and not-synchronized cells under micro- and standard gravity levels.

Mitochondrial Respiration in <i>Drosophila</i> Ovaries after a Full Cycle of Oogenesis under Simulated Microgravity,"Ogneva, Irina, V; Usik, Maria A.","Studies of the function of the female reproductive system in zero gravity are urgent for the future exploration of deep space. Female reproductive cells, oocytes, are rich in mitochondria, which allow oocytes to produce embryos. The rate of cellular respiration was determined to assess the functional state of the mitochondrial apparatus in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries in which the full cycle of oogenesis took place under simulated microgravity. Since cellular respiration depends on the state of the cytoskeleton, the contents of the main cytoskeletal proteins were determined by Western blotting. To modulate the structure of the cytoskeleton, essential phospholipids were administered per os at a dosage of 500 mg/kg in medium. The results of this study show that after a full cycle of oogenesis under simulated microgravity, the rate of cellular respiration in the fruit fly ovaries increases, apparently due to complex II of the respiratory chain. At the same time, we did not find any changes in the area of oocytes or in the content of proteins in the respiratory chain. However, changes were found in the relative contents of proteins of the actin cytoskeleton. There were no changes of essential phospholipids and no increase in the rate of cellular respiration of the ovaries after exposure to simulated microgravity. However, in the control, the administration of essential phospholipids led to a decrease in the efficiency of oxygen consumption in the flies' ovaries due to complexes IV-V.",2021,,CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,43,1,176-186,WOS:000667739800015,10.3390/cimb43010015,,#16554,Ogneva 2021,,
Data-driven geometric system identification for shape-underactuated dissipative systems,"Bittner, Brian; Hatton, Ross L.; Revzen, Shai","Modeling system dynamics becomes challenging when the properties of individual system components cannot be directly measured, and often requires identification of properties from observed motion. In this paper, we show that systems whose movement is highly dissipative have features which provide an opportunity to more easily identify models and more quickly optimize motions than would be possible with general techniques. Geometric mechanics provides means for reduction of the dynamics by environmental homogeneity, while the dissipative nature minimizes the role of second order (inertial) features in the dynamics. Here we extend the tools of geometric system identification to 'shape-underactuated dissipative systems (SUDS)'-systems whose motions are more dissipative than inertial, but whose actuation is restricted to a subset of the body shape coordinates. Many animal motions are SUDS, including micro-swimmers such as nematodes and flagellated bacteria, and granular locomotors such as snakes and lizards. Many soft robots are also SUDS, particularly robots that incorporate highly damped series elastic actuators to reduce the rigidity of their interactions with their environments during locomotion and manipulation. We motivate the use of SUDS models, and validate their ability to predict motion of a variety of simulated viscous swimming platforms. For a large class of SUDS, we show how the shape velocity actuation inputs can be directly converted into torque inputs, suggesting that systems with soft pneumatic or dielectric elastomer actuators can be modeled with the tools presented. Based on fundamental assumptions in the physics, we show how our model complexity scales linearly with the number of passive shape coordinates. This scaling offers a large reduction on the number of trials needed to identify the system model from experimental data, and may reduce overfitting. The sample efficiency of our method suggests its use in modeling, control, and optimization in robotics, and as a tool for the study of organismal motion in friction dominated regimes.",2022,,BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS,17,2,,WOS:000746694800001,10.1088/1748-3190/ac3b9c,,#12616,Bittner 2022,,
Quantitative proteomic analysis of cortex in the depressive-like behavior of rats induced by the simulated complex space environment,"Min, Rui; Chen, Zixuan; Wang, Yun; Deng, Zixuan; Zhang, Yongqian; Deng, Yulin","Long-term spaceflight has always been challenging for astronauts due to the extremely complicated space environmental conditions, including microgravity, noise, confinement, and circadian rhythms disorders, which may cause adverse effects on astronauts' mental health, such as anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, so far, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Hence, a novel type of box and rat cage was designed and built in order to simulate complex space environment on the ground. After earth-based simulation for 21 days, the rats exhibited the depressive-like behavior according to the sucrose preference and forced swimming test. We applied label-free quantitative proteomics to explore the molecular mechanisms of depressive-like behavior through global changes in cortical protein abundance, given that the cortex is the hub of emotional management. The results revealed up-regulated spliceosome proteins in contrast to down-regulated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glutamatergic, and GABAergic synapse related proteins in the simulated complex space environment (SCSE) group. Furthermore, PSD-95 protein was found down-regulated in mass spectrometry, reflecting its role in the psychopathology of depression, which was further validated by Western blotting. These findings provide valuable information to better understand the mechanisms of depressive-like behavior.Significance: Quantitative proteomic analysis can quantify differentially abundant proteins related to a variety of potential signaling pathways in the rat cortex in the simulated complex space environment. These findings not only provide valuable information to better understand the mechanisms of depressive-like behavior, but also might offer the potential targets and develop countermeasures for the mental disorders to maintain the health of astronauts during the long-term spaceflight.",2021,,JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS,237,,,WOS:000626636900003,10.1016/j.jprot.2021.104144,,#8621,Min 2021,,
Spaceflight-induced genetic and epigenetic changes in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome are independent of each other.,"Ou, Xiufang; Long, Likun; Wu, Ying; Yu, Yingjie; Lin, Xiuyun; Qi, Xin; Liu, Bao","An array of studies have reported that the spaceflight environment is mutagenic and may induce phenotypic and genetic changes in diverse organisms. We reported recently that in at least some plant species (e.g., rice) the spaceflight environment can be particularly potent in generating heritable epigenetic changes in the form of altered cytosine methylation patterns and activation of transposable elements. To further study the issue of spaceflight-induced genomic instability, and in particular to test whether the incurred genetic and epigenetic changes are connected or independent of each other, we performed the present study. We subjected seeds of the standard laboratory rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Nipponbare to a spaceflight in the spaceship Long March 2 for 18 days. We then investigated the genetic and DNA methylation stabilities of 11 randomly selected plants germinated from the spaceflown seeds by using two kinds of DNA markers, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). For AFLP, by using 15 primer combinations, we assessed 460 genomic loci and found that the frequencies of genetic changes across the 11 plants ranged from 0.7% to 6.7% with an average frequency of 3.5%. For MSAP, by using 14 primer combinations, we assessed 467 loci and detected the occurrence of four major types of cytosine methylation alterations at the CCGG sites, namely CG or CNG hypomethylation and CG or CNG hypermethylation. Collectively, the frequencies of the two kinds of hypermethylation, CG (1.95%) and CNG (1.44%), are about two times higher than those of the two kinds of hypomethylation, CG (0.76%) and CNG (0.80%), though different plants showed variable frequencies for each type of alteration. Further analysis suggested that both the genetic and cytosine methylation changes manifested apparent mutational bias towards specific genomic regions, but the two kinds of instabilities are independent of each other based on correlation analysis.",2010,/,Genome,53,7,524-32,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1139/g10-030,20616874,#2855,Ou 2010,,

These tests revealed a high biocompatibility for all parts of the EUs, which were in contact with the cells or the medium used. Most importantly, we found polyether ether ketones for surrounding the incubation chamber, which kept cellular viability above 80% and allowed the cells to adhere as long as they were exposed to normal gravity. After assembling the EU the ECs were cultured therein, where they showed good cell viability at least for 14 days.

"Plants in the Light of Ionizing Radiation: What Have We Learned From Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Other ""Hot"" Places?","Mousseau, Timothy A.; Moller, Anders Pape","Perhaps the main factor determining success of space travel will be the ability to control effects of ionizing radiation for humans, but also for other living organisms. Manned space travel will require the cultivation of food plants under conditions of prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation. Although there is a significant literature concerning the effects of acute high dose rate exposures on plant genetics, growth, and development, much less is known concerning the effects of chronic low dose irradiation especially those related to the impacts of the high energy protons and heavy ions that are encountered in the space environment. Here, we make the argument that in situ studies of the effects of radionuclides at nuclear accident sites (e.g., Chernobyl and Fukushima), atomic bomb test sites, and areas of naturally high radiation levels, could provide insights concerning the mechanisms of radiation effects on living systems that cannot be assessed short of conducting research in space, which is not yet feasible for large scale, long term, multigenerational experiments. In this article we review the literature concerning the effects of chronic low-dose rate radiation exposure from studies conducted in Chernobyl, Fukushima, and other regions of the world with high ambient radiation levels (parts of India in particular). In general, mutation rates and other measures of genetic damage are considerably elevated, pollen and seed viability are reduced, growth rates are slower, and the frequency of developmental abnormalities is increased, although there is considerable variation among taxa for these effects. In addition, there are interactions between radiation and other environmental stressors (e.g., temperature, drought, heavy metals) that may play important roles in determining susceptibility to radiation induced stress.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:000536777300001,10.3389/fpls.2020.00552,,#8880,Mousseau 2020,,

Most of the prior studies on effects of simulated space radiation on the heart and vasculature have been performed in mouse models. To provide data from a second animal species, two studies were performed to assess effects of high-energy charged particle radiation on the heart and abdominal aorta in a rat model.Materials and methods: In study A, male Long Evans rats were exposed to whole-body protons (250 MeV, 0.5 Gy) or oxygen ions (O-16, 600 MeV/n, 0.5 Gy), and ultrasonography was used to measure in vivo cardiac function and blood flow parameters at 3, 5, 9 and 12 months after radiation, followed by tissue collection at 12 months. In study B, male Long Evans rats were exposed to O-16 (1 GeV/n, 0.01-0.25 Gy), and hearts collected at 6 to 7 and 12 months for histology and western-blots.Results: Both protons (250 MeV) and O-16 (600 MeV/n) caused a decrease in left ventricular posterior wall thickness at 3-5 months, but did not change echocardiographic measures of cardiac function. In Pulsed-wave Doppler assessment of the abdominal aorta, an increase was seen in mean velocity, peak velocity, and velocity time integral at 12 months after O-16 (600 MeV/n), suggesting a change in vascular function. There were no significant changes in histopathology or histological quantification of total collagens in heart or aorta. On the other hand, an increase was seen in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and O-16 (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that radiation caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. O-16 (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n) caused increases in left ventricular protein levels of immune cell markers CD2, CD4, CD8, and CD68.Conclusion: A single low dose of whole body protons or O-16 in male Long Evans rats did not change cardiac function or induce gross pathological changes in the heart or aorta, but induced mild changes in vascular function and remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Altogether, studies in prior mouse models and the current work in rats indicate minor changes in cardiac function and structure after a low dose of single-ion radiation.",2020,,LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH,26,,62-68,WOS:000554557700007,10.1016/j.lssr.2020.04.002,,#15636,Sridharan 2020,,
Stem localization of sweet-pepper plants using the support wire as a visual cue,"Bac, C. W.; Hemming, J.; van Henten, E. J.","A robot arm should avoid collisions with the plant stem when it approaches a candidate sweet-pepper for harvesting. This study therefore aims at stem localization, a topic so far only studied under controlled lighting conditions. Objectives were to develop an algorithm capable of stem localization, using detection of the support wire that is twisted around the stem; to quantitatively evaluate performance of wire detection and stem localization under varying lighting conditions; to determine depth accuracy of stereo-vision under lab and greenhouse conditions. A single colour camera was mounted on a pneumatic slide to record image pairs with a small baseline of 1 cm. Artificial lighting was developed to mitigate disturbances caused by natural lighting conditions. An algorithm consisting of five steps was developed and includes novel components such as adaptive thresholding, use of support wires as a visual cue, use of object-based and 3D features and use of minimum expected stem distance. Wire detection rates (true-positive/scaled false-positive) were more favourable under moderate irradiance (94/5%) than under strong irradiance (74/26%). Error of stem localization was measured, in the horizontal plane, by Euclidean distance. Error was smaller for interpolated segments (0.8 cm), where a support wire was detected, than for extrapolated segments (1.5 cm), where a support wire was not detected. Error increased under strong irradiance. Accuracy of the stereo-vision system (+/- 0.4 cm) met the requirements (+/- 1 cm) in the lab, but not in the greenhouse (+/- 4.5 cm) due to plant movement during recording. The algorithm is probably capable to construct a useful collision map for robotic harvesting, if the issue of inaccurate stereo-vision can be resolved by directions proposed for future work. This is the first study regarding stem localization under varying lighting conditions, and can be useful for future applications in crops that grow along a support wire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis the in vivo bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) from the femurs was performed at the beginning and end of the experiment; plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, assessed by spectrophotometry, and estradiol, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was performed after the experiment. We evaluated changes in the trabecular and cortical structure of the femur, after disuse, by micro-computed tomography with high resolution, for analysis of cortical porosity, Raman spectroscopy to measure the amount of physicochemical properties, and the biomechanical test to estimate the changes in biomechanical properties. Our results demonstrated that, after 21 days, HLU animals had decreased femoral BMD, deteriorated bone microarchitecture, particularly in the cortical compartment, with changes in the physicochemical properties and porosity, and reduced deformation capacity of the bone and resistance to the bone stresses.

Fast all-fiber ultraviolet photodetector based on an Ag-decorated ZnO micro-pillar,"Ma, D.; Wang, Y.; Chen, C.; Cai, Z.; Zhang, J.; Liao, C.; Weng, X.; Liu, L.; Qu, J.","There are urgent demands of ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors with high sensitivity and fast response due to the wide application of ultraviolet light in the fields of medical treatment, space exploration, optical communication and semiconductor industry. The response speed of traditional ZnO-based UV photodetectors is always limited by the carrier mobility and electrical resistance caused by the external circuits. Utilizing the all-optical detection method may replace the complex circuit structure and effectively improve the response speed of photodetectors. Here, a fast-response fiber-optic UV photodetector is proposed, where a ZnO micro-pillar is fixed on the end face of a fiber-tip and acts as a Fabry-Pérot interferometer (FPI). Under the irradiation of UV light, the photo-generated carriers change the refractive index of the ZnO micro-pillar, leading to a redshift of the interference wavelengths of the ZnO FPI. To enhance this effect, a discontinuous Ag film with an island-like structure is coated on the surface of ZnO micro-pillars through magnetron sputtering, and therefore the sensitivity of the proposed device achieves to 1.13 nm/(W·cm-2), which is 3.9 times higher than that of without Ag-decoration, due to the intensification of photo-carrier change with the help of the Schottky junction formed between Ag film and ZnO micro-pillar. Meanwhile, since the response speed of the proposed device is mainly determined by the temporal RI change of ZnO micro-pillar, the fiber-optic UV photodetector also shows very fast response with a rise time of 35 ns and a decay time of 40 µs. The demonstrated structure takes full advantage of optical fiber devices, exhibiting compactness, flexibility, fast response and immune to electromagnetic interference, which paves a new way for the next generation of photodetection devices.",2023,,Optics express,31,3,5102-5112,,10.1364/OE.481844,,#3973,Ma 2023,,
LoRa Communications as an Enabler for Internet of Drones towards Large-Scale Livestock Monitoring in Rural Farms,"Behjati, Mehran; Noh, Aishah Binti Mohd; Alobaidy, Haider A. H.; Zulkifley, Muhammad Aidiel; Nordin, Rosdiadee; Abdullah, Nor Fadzilah","Currently, smart farming is considered an effective solution to enhance the productivity of farms; thereby, it has recently received broad interest from service providers to offer a wide range of applications, from pest identification to asset monitoring. Although the emergence of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), has led to significant advances in the smart farming industry, farming operations still need more efficient solutions. On the other hand, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, is growing rapidly across many civil application domains. This paper aims to develop a farm monitoring system that incorporates UAV, LPWAN, and IoT technologies to transform the current farm management approach and aid farmers in obtaining actionable data from their farm operations. In this regard, an IoT-based water quality monitoring system was developed because water is an essential aspect in livestock development. Then, based on the Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN(R)) technology, a multi-channel LoRaWAN(R) gateway was developed and integrated into a vertical takeoff and landing drone to convey collected data from the sensors to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, to develop LoRaWAN(R)-based aerial communication, a series of measurements and simulations were performed under different configurations and scenarios. Finally, to enhance the efficiency of aerial-based data collection, the UAV path planning was optimized. Measurement results showed that the maximum achievable LoRa coverage when operating on-air via the drone is about 10 km, and the Longley-Rice irregular terrain model provides the most suitable path loss model for the scenario of large-scale farms, and a multi-channel gateway with a spreading factor of 12 provides the most reliable communication link at a high drone speed (up to 95 km/h). Simulation results showed that the developed system can overcome the coverage limitation of LoRaWAN(R) and it can establish a reliable communication link over large-scale wireless sensor networks. In addition, it was shown that by optimizing flight paths, aerial data collection could be performed in a much shorter time than industrial mission planning (up to four times in our case).",2021,,SENSORS,21,15,,WOS:000682314500001,10.3390/s21155044,,#13863,Behjati 2021,,
Deep Learning-Based Pine Nematode Trees' Identification Using Multispectral and Visible UAV Imagery,"Qin, Bingxi; Sun, Fenggang; Shen, Weixing; Dong, Bin; Ma, Shencheng; Huo, Xinyu; Lan, Peng","Pine wilt disease (PWD) has become increasingly serious recently and causes great damage to the world's pine forest resources. The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing helps to identify pine nematode trees in time and has become a feasible and effective approach to precisely monitor PWD infection. However, a rapid and high-accuracy detection approach has not been well established in a complex terrain environment. To this end, a deep learning-based pine nematode tree identification method is proposed by fusing visible and multispectral imagery. A UAV equipped with a multispectral camera and a visible camera was used to obtain imagery, where multispectral imagery includes six bands, i.e., red, green, blue, near-infrared, red edge and red edge 750 nm. Two vegetation indexes, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge Index) are extracted as a typical feature according to the reflectance of infected trees in different spectral bands. The YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once v5)-based detection algorithm is adopted and optimized from different aspects to realize the identification of infected pine trees with high detection speed and accuracy. e.g., GhostNet is adopted to reduce the number of model parameters and improve the detection speed; a module combining a CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and a CA (Coordinate Attention) mechanism is designed to improve the feature extraction for small-scale pine nematode trees; Transformer module and BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) structure are applied to improve the feature fusion capability. The experiments show that the mAP@0.5 of the improved YOLOv5 model is 98.7%, the precision is 98.1%, the recall is 97.3%, the average detection speed of single imagery is 0.067 s, and the model size is 46.69 MB. All these metrics outperform other comparison methods. Therefore, the proposed method can achieve a fast and accurate detection of pine nematode trees, providing effective technical support for the control of a pine nematode epidemic.",2023,,DRONES,7,3,,WOS:000959153200001,10.3390/drones7030183,,#12633,Qin 2023,,
Lunar exploration and development--a sustainable model.,"Williamson, Mark","A long-term goal of space exploration is the development of a lunar settlement that will not only be largely self-sufficient but also contribute to the economy of the Earth-Moon system. Proposals for lunar mining and materials processing developments, as well as tourism-based applications, have appeared in the literature for many years. However, so great are the technical and financial difficulties associated with sustained lunar development that, more than 30 years after the end of the Apollo programme, there have been no practical advances towards this goal. While this may soon be remedied by a series of proposed unmanned orbiters, landers and rovers, the philosophy of lunar exploration and development remains the same as it has for decades: conquer, exploit, and ignore the consequences. By contrasting the well-recognised problems of Earth orbital debris and the barely recognised issue of intentional spacecraft impacts on the lunar surface, this paper illustrates the need for a new model for lunar exploration and development. This new paradigm would assign a value to the lunar environment and provide a balance between protection and exploitation, creating, in effect, a philosophy of sustainable development for the Moon. It is suggested that this new philosophy should be an integral part of any future strategy for lunar colonisation. Copyright c2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Some aspects of the comparative analysis of hemodynamic responses to LBNP tests in cosmonauts of different age groups,"Turchaninova, V. F.; Alferova, I. V.; Krivolapov, V. V.","The age -specific indicators of the functions of the cardiovascular system and its responses to the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test were studied in career cosmonauts for the first time. The results of 174 LBNP tests implemented within the standard medical monitoring program on board the 'Mir' orbital station (OS 'Mir'), using a Gamma- 01 device, and aboard the International Space Station (ISS), using the Gamma- 1M complex, were subjected to comparative analysis. In total, 38 cosmonauts from 25 long -duration space missions on board the 'Mir' OS and ISS, who were examined in their pre- flight state and during in flight periods, beginning, typically, on flight day (FD) 120, were subdivided into two age groups: 30- to 39 -year olds (their mean age was 36 ± 0.7 years; 39% of the total number of subjects) and 40- to 55 -year olds (their mean age was 46 ± 0.8 years; 61% of the total number of subjects). We have revealed age- specific indi cators for the hemodynamic status recorded at each stage of the investigation: at rest in a preflight state; responses of the indicators to the effects of microgravity; the relative dynamics of the indicators due to a simulated orthostatic posture, which was unidirectional but substantially different at the pre- and in -flight stages. For purposes of medical control, our results have shown that we need to establish age -specific references in our methodical approaches to the analysis and interpretation of the data received from monitoring cosmonauts’ health in their preflight state and during the entire mission and, which is particularly important in practical terms, when evaluating the LBNP test intolerance at different flight stages.

Hexapod Walking: an expansion to Walknet dealing with leg amputations and force oscillations,"Schilling, Malte; Cruse, Holk; Arena, Paolo","The control of the legs of a walking hexapod is a complex problem as the legs have three joints each, resulting in a total of 18 degrees of freedom. We addressed this problem using a decentralized architecture termed Walknet, which consists of peripheral pattern generators being coordinated through influences acting mainly between neighbouring legs. Both, the coordinating influences and the local control modules (each acting only on one leg), are biologically inspired. This investigation shows that it is possible to adapt this approach to account for additional biological data by (1) changing the structure of the selector net in a biological plausible way (including force as an analog variable), (2) introducing a biologically motivated coordination influence for coactivation between legs and (3) adding a hypothetical influence between hind and front legs. This network of controllers has been tested using a dynamic simulation. It is able to describe (a) the behaviour of animals walking with one or two legs being amputated and (b) force oscillations that occur in a specific experimental situation, the standing legs of a walking animal.",2007,,BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS,96,3,323-340,WOS:000244684800003,10.1007/s00422-006-0117-1,,#10657,Schilling 2007,,
"Comparison of acute proton, photon, and low-dose priming effects on genes associated with extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules in the lungs.","Tian, Jian; Tian, Sisi; Gridley, Daila S","UNLABELLED:, BACKGROUND: Crew members on space missions inevitably are exposed to low background radiation and can receive much higher doses during solar particle events (SPE) that consist primarily of protons. Ionizing radiation could cause lung pathologies. Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are believed to participate in fibrogenesis. Interactions between CAM and extracellular matrix (ECM) affect epithelial repair mechanisms in the lung. However, there are very limited data on biological effects of protons on normal lung tissue. Numerous reports have shown that exposure to low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation can result in radioadaptation that renders cells more resistant to subsequent acute radiation. The goal of this study was to compare expression of genes associated with ECM and CAM, as well as critical profibrotic mediators, in mouse lungs after acute irradiation with photons and protons, and also determine whether pre-exposure to LDR gamma-rays induces an adaptive effect., RESULTS: Overall, a marked difference was present in the proton vs. photon groups in gene expression. When compared to 0 Gy, more genes were affected by protons than by photons at both time points (11 vs. 6 on day 21 and 14 vs. 8 on day 56), and all genes affected by protons were upregulated. Many genes were modulated by LDR gamma-rays when combined with photons or protons. Col1a1, mmp14, and mmp15 were significantly upregulated by all radiation regimens on day 21. Similarly, the change in expression of profibrotic proteins was also detected after acute and combination irradiation., CONCLUSION: These data show that marked differences were present between acutely delivered protons and photons in modulating genes, and the effect of protons was more profound than that of photons. Pre-exposure to LDR gamma-rays 'normalized' some genes that were modified by acute irradiation.",2013,/,Fibrogenesis & tissue repair,6,1,4,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1755-1536-6-4,23374750,#2544,Tian 2013,,Animal

A Numerical Study of Biofilm Growth in a Microgravity Environment,"Aristotelous, A. C.; Papanicolaou, N. C.",A mathematical model is proposed to investigate the effect of microgravity on biofilm growth. We examine the case of biofilm suspended in a quiescent aqueous nutrient solution contained in a rectangular tank. The bacterial colony is assumed to follow logistic growth whereas nutrient absorption is assumed to follow Monod kinetics. The problem is modeled by a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations in two spatial dimensions solved using the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element method. Nutrient and biofilm concentrations are computed in microgravity and normal gravity conditions.

Staphylococcus aureus Sensitivity to Membrane Disrupting Antibacterials Is Increased under Microgravity.,"Jang, Hyochan; Choi, Seong Yeol; Mitchell, Robert J","In a survey of the International Space Station (ISS), the most common pathogenic bacterium identified in samples from the air, water and surfaces was Staphylococcus aureus. While growth under microgravity is known to cause physiological changes in microbial pathogens, including shifts in antibacterial sensitivity, its impact on S. aureus is not well understood. Using high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) to generate simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions in the lab, we found S. aureus lipid profiles are altered significantly, with a higher presence of branch-chained fatty acids (BCFAs) (14.8% to 35.4%) with a concomitant reduction (41.3% to 31.4%) in straight-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) under SMG. This shift significantly increased the sensitivity of this pathogen to daptomycin, a membrane-acting antibiotic, leading to 12.1-fold better killing under SMG. Comparative assays with two additional compounds, i.e., SDS and violacein, confirmed S. aureus is more susceptible to membrane-disrupting agents, with 0.04% SDS and 0.6 mg/L violacein resulting in 22.9- and 12.8-fold better killing in SMG than normal gravity, respectively. As humankind seeks to establish permanent colonies in space, these results demonstrate the increased potency of membrane-active antibacterials to control the presence and spread of S. aureus, and potentially other pathogens.",2023,/,Cells,12,14,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells12141907,37508571,#304,Jang 2023,,
Both gravistimulation onset and removal trigger an increase of cytoplasmic free calcium in statocytes of roots grown in microgravity,"Bizet, Francois; Pereda-Loth, Veronica; Chauvet, Hugo; Gerard, Joelle; Eche, Brigitte; Girousse, Christine; Courtade, Monique; Perbal, Gerald; Legue, Valerie","Gravity is a permanent environmental signal guiding plant growth and development. Gravity sensing in plants starts with the displacement of starch-filled plastids called statoliths, ultimately leading to auxin redistribution and organ curvature. While the involvement in gravity sensing of several actors such as calcium is known, the effect of statolith displacement on calcium changes remains enigmatic. Microgravity is a unique environmental condition offering the opportunity to decipher this link. In this study, roots of Brassica napus were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) either in microgravity or in a centrifuge simulating Earth gravity. The impact of short simulated gravity onset and removal was measured on statolith positioning and intracellular free calcium was assessed using pyroantimonate precipitates as cytosolic calcium markers. Our findings show that a ten-minute onset or removal of gravity induces very low statolith displacement, but which is, nevertheless, associated with an increase of the number of pyroantimonate precipitates. These results highlight that a change in the cytosolic calcium distribution is triggered in absence of a significant statolith displacement.",2018,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,8,,,WOS:000440144400059,10.1038/s41598-018-29788-7,,#9302,Bizet 2018,,
Oxidative stress and alterations in actin cytoskeleton trigger glutathione efflux in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>,"Bradamante, Silvia; Villa, Alessandro; Versari, Silvia; Barenghi, Livia; Orlandi, Ivan; Vai, Marina","A marked deficiency in glutathione (GSH), the most abundant antioxidant in living systems, plays a major role in aging and the pathogenesis of diseases ranging from neurological disorders to early atherosclerosis and the impairment of various immunological functions. In an attempt to shed light on GSH homeostasis, we carried out the space experiment SCORE (Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidative stress response evaluation) during the FOTON-M3 mission. Microgravity and hyperoxic conditions induced an enormous extracellular release of GSH from S. cerevisiae cells (approximate to 40% w/dw), changed the distribution of the buds, and activated the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) and cell integrity/PKC pathways, as well as protein carbonylation. The results from the single spaceflight experiment were validated by a complete set of experiments under conditions of simulated microgravity and indicate that cytoskeletal alterations are mainly responsible for the observed effects. The results of ground experiments in which we induced cytoskeletal modifications by means of treatment with dihydrocytochalasin B (DHCB), a potent inhibitor of actin polymerisation, or (R)-(+)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride monohydrate (Y-27632), a selective ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein serine/threonine kinase) inhibitor, confirmed the role of actin in GSH efflux.

New perspectives on viable microbial communities in low-biomass cleanroom environments.,"Vaishampayan, Parag; Probst, Alexander J; La Duc, Myron T; Bargoma, Emilee; Benardini, James N; Andersen, Gary L; Venkateswaran, Kasthuri","The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments.

The electroencephalogram as a screening tool in pilot applicants,"Zifkin, B.G.","The electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to screen pilot candidates for professional licensure irrespective of medical history in many European countries; applicants with paroxysmal abnormalities are excluded. The aim is to reduce the risk of later seizures in flight, which may cause accident or death, but there is no clear evidence that EEG screening can lead to any significant risk reduction. This is partly due to the low predictive value of the EEG, the low risk of seizure in healthy young adults, and the low risk of commercial aircraft accidents. Later-onset seizures, unrelated to the results of earlier screening, cannot be predicted or prevented by screening. Some benefit cannot be excluded, but may be difficult to demonstrate in prospective studies.

"The Photochemistry of Unprotected DNA and DNA inside Bacillus subtilis Spores Exposed to Simulated Martian Surface Conditions of Atmospheric Composition, Temperature, Pressure, and Solar Radiation.","Nicholson, Wayne L; Schuerger, Andrew C; Douki, Thierry","DNA is considered a potential biomarker for life-detection experiments destined for Mars. Experiments were conducted to examine the photochemistry of bacterial DNA, either unprotected or within Bacillus subtilis spores, in response to exposure to simulated martian surface conditions consisting of the following: temperature (-10degreeC), pressure (0.7 kPa), atmospheric composition [CO2 (95.54%), N2 (2.7%), Ar (1.6%), O2 (0.13%), and H2O (0.03%)], and UV-visible-near IR solar radiation spectrum (200-1100 nm) calibrated to 4 W/m2 of UVC (200-280 nm). While the majority (99.9%) of viable spores deposited in multiple layers on spacecraft-qualified aluminum coupons were inactivated within 5 min, a detectable fraction survived for up to the equivalent of ~115 martian sols. Spore photoproduct (SP) was the major lesion detected in spore DNA, with minor amounts of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), in the order TT CPD > TC CPD >> CT CPD. In addition, the (6-4)TC, but not the (6-4)TT, photoproduct was detected in spore DNA. When unprotected DNA was exposed to simulated martian conditions, all photoproducts were detected. Surprisingly, the (6-4)TC photoproduct was the major photoproduct, followed by SP ~ TT CPD > TC CPD > (6-4)TT > CT CPD > CC CPD. Differences in the photochemistry of unprotected DNA and spore DNA in response to simulated martian surface conditions versus laboratory conditions are reviewed and discussed. The results have implications for the planning of future life-detection experiments that use DNA as the target, and for the long-term persistence on Mars of forward contaminants or their DNA.

Acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide mediates structural remodeling of cerebral artery and small mesenteric artery in simulated weightless rats,"Su, Yu-Ting; Cheng, Yao-Ping; Zhang, Xi; Xie, Xiao-Ping; Chang, Yao-Ming; Bao, Jun-Xiang","Aims: Weightlessness exposure conduces to substantial vascular remodeling, mechanisms behind which remain unclear. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzed ceramide (Cer) generation accounts for multiple vascular disorders, so the role of it in adjustment of cerebral artery (CA) and small mesenteric artery (MA) was investigated in simulated weightless rats.Main methods: Rats were hindlimb unloaded tail suspended (HU) to simulate the effect of weightlessness. Arterial morphology was examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cer abundance was measured by immunohistochemistry. Western blotting was used to detect protein content. Apoptosis was detected by transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling.Key findings: During 4 weeks of tail suspension, intima-media thickness (IMT) and media cross section area (CSA) were increased gradually in CA but decreased gradually in MA (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, the apoptosis and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells were reduced and enhanced respectively in CA (P < 0.05), while promoted and restrained in MA (P < 0.05). As compared to control, both ASM protein expression and Cer content were lowered in CA and elevated in MA of HU rats (P < 0.05). Permeable Cer incubation reversed the change of apoptosis and proliferation in CA of HU rats, while ASM inhibition recapitulated it in control rats.

Citizen science unoccupied aerial vehicles: A technique for advancing coastal data acquisition for management and research,"Ierodiaconou, Daniel; Kennedy, David M.; Pucino, Nicolas; Allan, Blake M.; McCarroll, R. Jak; Ferns, Lawrance W.; Carvalho, Rafael C.; Sorrell, Karina; Leach, Chloe; Young, Mary","Coasts are highly dynamic systems. Understanding how they respond to individual storms events and to future climate change is difficult as local boundary conditions determines their evolutionary trajectory. A lack of field data at this local scale therefore limits the ability of managers and researchers to apply existing modelling frameworks to their region of interest to ensure preservation of the natural environment. Data acquisition through low-cost Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become a viable means for obtaining high-resolution surveys (cm-scale) on the coast for whole sediment compartments (km-scale). A continued limitation however is the intensive labour costs involved in data acquisition. Here we show the power of Citizen Science in providing high quality, cost-effective data collection, when provided with adequate training and resources along a high-energy, temperate coast in Victoria, Australia. This was conducted through the Victorian Coastal Monitoring Program (VCMP), formed in 2018 as a collaboration between Australian universities and the Victorian State Government. As of 2022, this program covered 28 sites, with over 450 individual surveys taken at 6-8 week intervals. The VCMP has guided and driven significant management actions on the coast from realignment of coastal walking paths for public safety to measuring sand renourishment success. In this paper we (i) present the Citizen Science UAV program methodology, as an example that can be replicated in other jurisdictions, and (ii) illustrate, through a case-study of a sandy beach and rocky cliff, the benefits and precision achievable using our Citizen Science approach. We outline how outputs can be made widely available and applied to coastal man-agement, with the aid of data portals and decision support systems. This data accessibility has been central to our community engagement, enabling citizen scientists to conduct their own bespoke analysis for co-creation of management solutions for their local area.

Cascaded navigation control for agricultural vehicles tracking straight paths,Hu Jingtao; Li Taochang,"In precision agriculture (PA), an agricultural vehicle navigation system is essential and the navigation control accuracy is important in this system. As straight path tracking is the major operating mode of agricultural vehicles on large fields, a cascaded navigation control method for straight path tracking is proposed in this study. Firstly, a cascaded navigation control structure for the agricultural vehicle was discussed. Based on this structure, the navigation control task was decomposed into two cascaded control tasks, namely, the path tracking control task and the steering control task. Secondly, a relative kinematics model of agricultural vehicles was deduced, and an optimal Proportional-Derivative (PD) method based on the deduced model was developed in the path tracking control task. Then, an improved PD method based on a transition process was proposed in the steering control task to enhance the performance of the steering control subsystem. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method were verified by a series of experiments.

Revisions to Acute/Off-Nominal Limits for Benzene in Spacecraft Air,"Ryder, Valerie Elizabeth; Williams, Edward Spencer","The previous short-term (1-h and 24-h) Spacecraft Maximal Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) for benzene were established at 10 and 3 ppm by NASA in 1996, based on a study of mice in which no hematological effects were noted following two 6-h exposures to benzene. When the benzene SMACs were updated in 2008, there was no revision to the short-term SMAC limits. Rather, that effort developed a long-term SMAC (1000-d) for Exploration mission scenarios.Acute benzene exposures can cause numerous neurological effects, and long-term exposure to low levels is well-known to cause acute myeloid leukemia. Since publication of the original benzene SMACs, the National Academy of Sciences developed interim Acute Exposure Guideline Limits (AEGLs) for unintentional releases of benzene into the air. Based on the data used to establish the AEGLs, we have increased our short-term, off-nominal limits for benzene in crewed spacecraft to 40 ppm and 6.7 ppm for 1-h and 24-h, respectively.",2023,,AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE,94,7,544-545,WOS:001028817600007,10.3357/AMHP.6222.2023,,#16745,Ryder 2023,,
"Transcriptomics, NF-kappaB Pathway, and Their Potential Spaceflight-Related Health Consequences.","Zhang, Ye; Moreno-Villanueva, Maria; Krieger, Stephanie; Ramesh, Govindarajan T; Neelam, Srujana; Wu, Honglu","In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-kappaB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-kappaB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-kappaB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-kappaB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-kappaB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.",2017,/,International journal of molecular sciences,18,6,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms18061166,28561779,#1717,Zhang 2017,,
Dynamics of underwater legged locomotion: modeling and experiments on an octopus-inspired robot,"Calisti, M.; Corucci, F.; Arienti, A.; Laschi, C.","This paper studies underwater legged locomotion (ULL) by means of a robotic octopus-inspired prototype and its associated model. Two different types of propulsive actions are embedded into the robot model: reaction forces due to leg contact with the ground and hydrodynamic forces such as the drag arising from the sculling motion of the legs. Dynamic parameters of the model are estimated by means of evolutionary techniques and subsequently the model is exploited to highlight some distinctive features of ULL. Specifically, the separation between the center of buoyancy (CoB)/center of mass and density affect the stability and speed of the robot, whereas the sculling movements contribute to propelling the robot even when its legs are detached from the ground. The relevance of these effects is demonstrated through robotic experiments and model simulations; moreover, by slightly changing the position of the CoB in the presence of the same feed-forward activation, a number of different behaviors (i.e. forward and backward locomotion at different speeds) are achieved.",2015,,BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS,10,4,,WOS:000362358100016,10.1088/1748-3190/10/4/046012,,#10507,Calisti 2015,,
Laser-Based Pedestrian Tracking in Outdoor Environments by Multiple Mobile Robots,"Ozaki, Masataka; Kakimuma, Kei; Hashimoto, Masafumi; Takahashi, Kazuhiko","This paper presents an outdoors laser-based pedestrian tracking system using a group of mobile robots located near each other. Each robot detects pedestrians from its own laser scan image using an occupancy-grid-based method, and the robot tracks the detected pedestrians via Kalman filtering and global-nearest-neighbor (GNN)-based data association. The tracking data is broadcast to multiple robots through intercommunication and is combined using the covariance intersection (CI) method. For pedestrian tracking, each robot identifies its own posture using real-time-kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) and laser scan matching. Using our cooperative tracking method, all the robots share the tracking data with each other; hence, individual robots can always recognize pedestrians that are invisible to any other robot. The simulation and experimental results show that cooperating tracking provides the tracking performance better than conventional individual tracking does. Our tracking system functions in a decentralized manner without any central server, and therefore, this provides a degree of scalability and robustness that cannot be achieved by conventional centralized architectures.",2012,,SENSORS,12,11,14489-14507,WOS:000311429500014,10.3390/s121114489,,#11793,Ozaki 2012,,
Description and Genome Characterization of Three Novel Fungal Strains Isolated from Mars 2020 Mission-Associated Spacecraft Assembly Facility Surfaces-Recommendations for Two New Genera and One Species.,"Chander, Atul Munish; Teixeira, Marcus de Melo; Singh, Nitin K; Williams, Michael P; Simpson, Anna C; Damle, Namita; Parker, Ceth W; Stajich, Jason E; Mason, Christopher E; Torok, Tamas; Venkateswaran, Kasthuri","National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) spacecraft assembly facilities are monitored for the presence of any bacteria or fungi that might conceivably survive a transfer to an extraterrestrial environment. Fungi present a broad and diverse range of phenotypic and functional traits to adapt to extreme conditions, hence the detection of fungi and subsequent eradication of them are needed to prevent forward contamination for future NASA missions. During the construction and assembly for the Mars 2020 mission, three fungal strains with unique morphological and phylogenetic properties were isolated from spacecraft assembly facilities. The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB, TUB, TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses supported the hypothesis that these were novel species. Here we report the genus or species-level classification of these three novel strains via a polyphasic approach using phylogenetic analysis, colony and cell morphology, and comparative analysis of WGS. The strain FJI-L9-BK-P1 isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF) exhibited a putative phylogenetic relationship with the strain Aaosphaeria arxii CBS175.79 but showed distinct morphology and microscopic features. Another JPL-SAF strain, FJII-L3-CM-DR1, was phylogenetically distinct from members of the family Trichomeriaceae and exhibited morphologically different features from the genera Lithohypha and Strelitziana. The strain FKI-L1-BK-DR1 isolated from the Kennedy Space Center facility was identified as a member of Dothideomycetes incertae sedis and is closely related to the family Kirschsteiniotheliaceae according to a phylogenetic analysis. The polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the recommendation for establishing two novel genera and one novel species. The names Aaosphaeria pasadenensis (FJI-L9-BK-P1 = NRRL 64424 = DSM 114621), Pasadenomyces melaninifex (FJII-L3-CM-DR1 = NRRL 64433 = DSM 114623), and Floridaphiala radiotolerans (FKI-L1-BK-DR1 = NRRL 64434 = DSM 114624) are proposed as type species.

Assessment Model for Rapid Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission under Government Control.,"Pan, Lihu; Su, Ya; Yan, Huimin; Zhang, Rui","The rapid suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains a priority for maintaining public health security throughout the world, and the agile adjustment of government prevention and control strategies according to the spread of the epidemic is crucial for controlling the spread of the epidemic. Thus, in this study, a multi-agent modeling approach was developed for constructing an assessment model for the rapid suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission under government control. Different from previous mathematical models, this model combines computer technology and geographic information system to abstract human beings in different states into micro-agents with self-control and independent decision-making ability; defines the rules of agent behavior and interaction; and describes the mobility, heterogeneity, contact behavior patterns, and dynamic interactive feedback mechanism of space environment. The real geospatial and social environment in Taiyuan was considered as a case study. In the implemented model, the government agent could adjust the response level and prevention and control policies for major public health emergencies in real time according to the development of the epidemic, and different intervention strategies were provided to improve disease control methods in the simulation experiment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is widely applicable, and it can not only judge the effectiveness of intervention measures in time but also analyze the virus transmission status in complex urban systems and its change trend under different intervention measures, thereby providing scientific guidance to support urban public health safety.",2022,/,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,7,12,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed7120399,36548654,#242,Pan 2022,,

Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential.

The faster proliferation of endothelial cells cultured in the NRG bioreactor (doubling time : 28 +/- 1.7 vs. 43 +/- 5.6 h of the control grown in RWV) are attributed to different oxygenation conditions and medium wash out.,2004,/,Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology,11,2,P191-2,,,16237833,#3290,Bradamante 2004,,
Multiscale Parallel Heading Error Processing Model for Polarization Compass,"Zhao, Donghua; Wu, Yicheng; Liu, Wancheng; Wu, Xindong; Zhao, Jiangting; Wang, Chenguang; Shen, Chong; Tang, Jun; Liu, Jun","A multiscale parallel processing model of heading error for the polarization compass (PC) is developed in this article. Existing state-of-the-art schemes of raising heading measurement precision are implemented relying on not only ideal assumption in noiseless heading output from the PC but also the polynomial method employed to calculate the heading error caused by the varied attitude angles of PC, which leads to fall sharply in the PC heading accuracy in real applications. Moreover, the aforementioned denoising and heading error compensation are conducted independently. Here we specifically concentrate on a novel and promising parallel processing model for heading error as a way to improve the PC heading accuracy, where a comprehensive analysis of heading error sources is first carried out for the PC. Subsequently, the proposed multiscale parallel error processing model is presented to improve heading accuracy for the PC by repressing noise as well as compensating heading errors that are implemented synchronously. Specifically, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is exploited to decompose the original heading data output from PC into multiple intrinsic mode functions, which characterizes binned modes (BIMFs) with high-to-low frequencies by seeking the ensemble of the decomposed modes and their respective center frequencies. An adaptive multiscale principle component analysis (MS- PCA) scheme denoising approach exploiting the principle contribution rate is performed to attenuate the noise in the high-frequency BIMFs. An effective compensation approach with a long short-term memory (LSTM) modeling is introduced straightforward to compensate for the heading error for the low-frequency BIMF concurrently. The rotational test is carried out to verify that the heading error processed by VMDPCA denoising and LSTM compensating, which are the most effective among the comparison algorithms and the RMSE of 0.3505 and 0.2668, increased by 80.10% and 82.00%, respectively. The UAV flight test demonstrates that the RMSE of the parallel scheme using VMD-PCA and LSTM performed simultaneously is the minimum values of 0.1282 and 71% higher than the original navigation error. It can be seen from various experimental results that the proposed multiscale parallel processing model of denoising and error compensation procedure performed synchronously shows attractive performance gains with respect to emerging single processing in terms of increasing the accuracy of the PC heading measurement.",2022,,IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL,22,18,17882-17892,WOS:000880106500063,10.1109/JSEN.2022.3192290,,#13532,Zhao 2022,,
Regulated Morphogen Gradients for Target Surrounding and Adaptive Shape Formation,"Shirazi, Ataollah Ramezan; Jin, Yaochu","In swarm robotics, developing algorithms for self-organizing minimalistic robots has become a popular research topic. Unlike others, minimalistic robots may not be able to self-localize themselves, making it very challenging to accomplish missions such as surrounding a target, whose position is typically unknown. In target surroundings, reaching a target and joining the swarm do not always lead to a satisfactory enclosure of the target. Furthermore, it is impossible for individual minimalistic robots to figure out what a global shape of the swarm should be without a collective decision making. In this article, we make use of diffusion and reaction of two morphogens for target surrounding and formation of a circular shape swarm.

Morpho-functional alterations in testicular and nervous cells submitted to modelled microgravity.,"Uva, B M; Strollo, F; Ricci, F; Pastorino, M; Mason, J I; Masini, M A","Humans, as well as other life forms, have developed on earth under the terrestrial gravitational field. Questions concerning the effect of the gravity vector changes on the animal physiology have begun to emerge only in the last decades. Physiological alterations were observed during space flights, but space-born investigations at cellular levels are still very limited. Earth-bound simulations of low gravity obtained with the 3-dimensional Random Positioning Machine are extensively utilized to explore the effects of microgravity on cell function. After only a few minutes, weightlessness affected the cytoskeleton of lymphocytes, astrocytes, neurons and testicular cells, disorganizing microtubules, intermediate filaments and microfilaments. Cell division was impaired, mitochondria were disrupted and apoptotic phenomena occurred. Expression of proteins involved in transmembrane ion and water transport were also affected. In the Leydig cells the key enzymes (3beta- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases) leading to testosterone synthesis were depressed. However, after 20 h of clinorotation the cells were able to synthesize heat shock proteins that initiated protection and recovery. The cytoskeleton was again well organized, normal mitosis occurred and the percentage of apoptotic cells returned to the range of 5%, similar to the control cultures. Ion and water transmembrane proteins and steroid dehydrogenases returned to normal levels. Long-term experiments showed that low gravity induced only transient alterations in the cultured cells, which were able to adapt to the gravity vector changes and to regain normal activity.

The study included 24 drivers between the ages of 18 and 24 years. A baseline condition with no e-mail system was compared with a simple and a complex e-mail system in both simple and complex driving environments. The results show a 30% (310 ms) increase in reaction time when the speech-based system is used. Subjective workload ratings and probe questions also indicate that speech-based interaction introduces a significant cognitive load, which was highest for the complex e-mail system.

3D Forest Mapping Using A Low-Cost UAV Laser Scanning System: Investigation and Comparison,"Li, Jianping; Yang, Bisheng; Cong, Yangzi; Cao, Lin; Fu, Xiaoyao; Dong, Zhen","Automatic 3D forest mapping and individual tree characteristics estimation are essential for forest management and ecosystem maintenance. The low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) laser scanning (ULS) is a newly developed tool for cost-effectively collecting 3D information and attempts to use it for 3D forest mapping have been made, due to its capability to provide 3D information with a lower cost and higher flexibility than the standard ULS and airborne laser scanning (ALS). As the direct georeferenced point clouds may suffer from distortion caused by the poor performance of a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), and 3D forest mapping using low-cost ULS poses a great challenge. Therefore, this paper utilized global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and IMU aided Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for trajectory estimation, and, hence, overcomes the poor performance of low-cost IMUs. The accuracy of the low-cost ULS point clouds was compared with the ground truth data collected by a commercial ULS system. Furthermore, the effectiveness of individual trees segmentation and tree characteristics estimation derived from the low-cost ULS point clouds were accessed. Experiments were undertaken in Dongtai forest farm, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China. The results showed that the low-cost ULS achieved good point clouds quality from visual inspection and comparable individual tree segmentation results (P = 0.87, r = 0.84, F = 0.85) with the commercial system. Individual tree height estimation performed well (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.998, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.323 m) using the low-cost ULS. As for individual tree crown diameter estimation, low-cost ULS achieved good results (R-2 = 0.806, RMSE = 0.195 m) after eliminating outliers. In general, such results illustrated the high potential of the low-cost ULS in 3D forest mapping, even though 3D forest mapping using the low-cost ULS requires further research.",2019,,REMOTE SENSING,11,6,,WOS:000464554600005,10.3390/rs11060717,,#13752,Li 2019,,
Gravity-Dependent Changes in Bioconvection of <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> during Parabolic Flight: Increases in Wave Number Induced by Pre- and Post-Parabola Hypergravity,"Kage, Azusa; Asato, Eriko; Chiba, Yoko; Wada, Yuuko; Katsu-Kimura, Yumiko; Kubota, Ayami; Sawai, Satoe; Niihori, Maki; Baba, Shoji A.; Mogami, Yoshihiro","Bioconvection emerges in a dense suspension of swimming protists as a consequence of their negative-gravitactic upward migration and later settling as a blob of density greater than that of water. Thus, gravity is an important parameter governing bioconvective pattern formation. However, inconsistencies are found in previous studies dealing with the response of bioconvection patterns to increased gravity acceleration (hypergravity); the wave number of the patterns has been reported to decrease during the hypergravity phases of parabolic aircraft flight, while it increases in centrifugal hypergravity. In this paper, we reassess the responses of bioconvection to altered gravity during parabolic flight on the basis of vertical and horizontal observations of the patterns formed by Tetrahymena thermophila and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Spatiotemporal analyses of the horizontal-patterns revealed an increase in the pattern wave number in both pre-and post-parabola hypergravity. Vertical pattern analysis was generally in line with the horizontal pattern analysis, and further revealed that hypergravity-induced changes preceded at the top layer of the suspensions while microgravity-induced changes appeared to occur from the bottom part of the settling blobs. The responses to altered gravity were rather different between the two sample species: T. thermophila tended to drastically modify its bioconvection patterns in response to changes in gravity level, while the patterns of C. reinhardtii responded to a much lesser extent. This difference can be attributed to the distinct physical and physiological properties of the individual organisms, suggesting a significant contribution of the gyrotactic property to the swimming behavior of some protists.",2011,,ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE,28,3,206-214,WOS:000287731000007,10.2108/zsj.28.206,,#16591,Kage 2011,,

Monocyte phenotype and cytokine production profiles are dysregulated by short-duration spaceflight.,"Crucian, Brian; Stowe, Raymond; Quiriarte, Heather; Pierson, Duane; Sams, Clarence","INTRODUCTION: Immune system dysregulation has been demonstrated to occur during and immediately following spaceflight. As the initial bias and magnitude for an immune response is heavily influenced by monocyte/macrophage secreted cytokines, this study investigated monocyte phenotype and cytokine production patterns following short-duration spaceflight., METHODS: Secreted cytokine profiles were examined by cytometric bead array analysis of culture supernatants following whole blood culture activation with LPS or PMA+ionomycin. Nine short-duration Space Shuttle crewmembers participated in this study., RESULTS: Peripheral monocyte percentages were unaltered postflight. Constitutive monocyte expression of both CD62L and HLA-DR was reduced following spaceflight in a mission-specific fashion. Loss of either molecule indicates a functional disability of monocytes, either by inhibition of adhesion and tissue migration (CD62L) or by impaired antigen presentation (HLA-DR). Following LPS stimulation of monocytes, postflight expression of IL-6, TNFalpha, and IL-10 were significantly reduced (by 43%, 44%, and 41%, respectively) and expression of IL-1b was elevated (65%). IL-8 production was either elevated or reduced in a mission-specific fashion. Following PMA+ionomycin stimulation of all leukocyte populations, only expression of IL-6 was significantly reduced postflight., DISCUSSION: These data indicate that changes in monocyte constitutive phenotype and inflammatory cytokine production occur following short-duration spaceflight, which may impact overall crewmember immunocompetence. Also, monocyte/macrophage function may be highly sensitive to mission specific parameters.",2011,/,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",82,9,857-62,,,21888268,#2753,Crucian 2011,,

An actuator at the rear of the device adjusted the pitch of the perforator and sprayer, and a monitoring system was installed to aid the operator in targeting. The operating parameters of the UAV exterminator were evaluated in laboratory tests, with a spray distance of 5 m deemed suitable. To evaluate the system's pest-control performance, several V. velutina nests were targeted in field tests. An insecticidal effect of over 99% was achieved using two pyrethrum-based pesticides (15% pyrethrum extract and 10% pyrethrum extract with additives). In addition, compared to conventional nest-removal methods, the UAV exterminator reduced the work time by 85% and the cost by 54.9%.",2023,,DRONES,7,4,,WOS:000977785100001,10.3390/drones7040281,,#12591,Lee 2023,,
Redundancy Exploitation of an 8-DoF Robotic Assistant for Doppler Sonography,"Gautreau, Elie; Sandoval, Juan; Thomas, Aurelien; Guilhem, Jean-Michel; Carbone, Giuseppe; Zeghloul, Said; Laribi, Med Amine","The design of a teleoperated 8-DoF redundant robot for Doppler sonography is detailed in this paper. The proposed robot is composed of a 7-DoF robotic arm mounted on a 1-DoF linear axis. This solution has been conceived to allow Doppler ultrasound examination of the entire patient's body. This paper details the design of the platform and proposes two alternative control modes to deal with its redundancy at the torque level. The first control mode considers the robot as a full 8-DoF kinematics chain, synchronizing the action of the eight joints and improving the global robot manipulability. The second control mode decouples the 7-DoF arm and the linear axis controllers and proposes a switching strategy to activate the linear axis motion when the robot arm approaches the workspace limits. Moreover, a new adaptive Joint-Limit Avoidance (JLA) strategy is proposed with the aim of exploiting the redundancy of the 7-DoF anthropomorphic arm. Unlike classical JLA approaches, a weighting matrix is actively adapted to prioritize those joints that are approaching the mechanical limits. Simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control modes.",2022,,ACTUATORS,11,2,,WOS:000770800000001,10.3390/act11020033,,#10588,Gautreau 2022,,
Immunohistochemical evidence that culture in the high aspect rotating vessel can up-regulate hormone expression in growth dedifferentiated PHHI-derived islet cells.,"Webb, M'Balu A; Platton, Sharon L; Dennison, Ashley R; James, Roger F L","Islet cells derived from patients with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) have the ability to grow readily in simple culture media. However, as with primary islets and cell lines, they lose hormone expression upon growth. In this study, we have investigated the role of three-dimensional cell-to-cell contact in the reinitiation of hormone expression in growth dedifferentiated PHHI-derived cells. Two main methods of cell aggregation were studied; the promotion of pseudoislets through petri dish culture and the creation of cell aggregates in the microgravity environment of the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV). Immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA assay showed that petri dish culture did not re-establish endocrine expression in any of the five cultures tested. However, through HARV technology, we have demonstrated that it is possible to reactivate insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and GAD expression in PHHI-derived cells that had previously stopped expressing these markers. These results indicate that the unique environment of the HARV can be conducive to the upregulation of endocrine expression of islet-derived cells and optimization of culture conditions may prove useful in the sphere of beta cell proliferation.",2007,/,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Cortisol and C-Reactive Protein Vary During Sleep Loss and Recovery but Are Not Markers of Neurobehavioral Resilience,"Yamazaki, Erika M.; Antler, Caroline A.; Casale, Courtney E.; MacMullen, Laura E.; Ecker, Adrian J.; Goel, Namni","Cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) typically change during total sleep deprivation (TSD) and psychological stress; however, it remains unknown whether these biological markers can differentiate robust individual differences in neurobehavioral performance and self-rated sleepiness resulting from these stressors. Additionally, little is known about cortisol and CRP recovery after TSD. In our study, 32 healthy adults (ages 27-53; mean +/- SD, 35.1 +/- 7.1 years; 14 females) participated in a highly controlled 5-day experiment in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA), a high-fidelity National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space analog isolation facility, consisting of two baseline nights, 39 h TSD, and two recovery nights. Psychological stress was induced by a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) on the afternoon of TSD. Salivary cortisol and plasma CRP were obtained at six time points, before (pre-study), during [baseline, the morning of TSD (TSD AM), the afternoon of TSD (TSD PM), and recovery], and after (post-study) the experiment. A neurobehavioral test battery, including measures of behavioral attention and cognitive throughput, and a self-report measure of sleepiness, was administered 11 times. Resilient and vulnerable groups were defined by a median split on the average TSD performance or sleepiness score. Low and high pre-study cortisol and CRP were defined by a median split on respective values at pre-study. Cortisol and CRP both changed significantly across the study, with cortisol, but not CRP, increasing during TSD. During recovery, cortisol levels did not return to pre-TSD levels, whereas CRP levels did not differ from baseline. When sex was added as a between-subject factor, the time x sex interaction was significant for cortisol. Resilient and vulnerable groups did not differ in cortisol and CRP, and low and high pre-study cortisol/CRP groups did not differ on performance tasks or self-reported sleepiness. Thus, both cortisol and CRP reliably changed in a normal, healthy population as a result of sleep loss; however, cortisol and CRP were not markers of neurobehavioral resilience to TSD and stress in this study.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,12,,,WOS:000741893300001,10.3389/fphys.2021.782860,,#17585,Yamazaki 2021,,Sleep Medicine
Sensor-level computer vision with pixel processor arrays for agile robots,"Dudek, Piotr; Richardson, Thomas; Bose, Laurie; Carey, Stephen; Chen, Jianing; Greatwood, Colin; Liu, Yanan; Mayol-Cuevas, Walterio","Vision processing for control of agile autonomous robots requires low-latency computation, within a limited power and space budget. This is challenging for conventional computing hardware. Parallel processor arrays (PPAs) are a new class of vision sensor devices that exploit advances in semiconductor technology, embedding a processor within each pixel of the image sensor array. Sensed pixel data are processed on the focal plane, and only a small amount of relevant information is transmitted out of the vision sensor. This tight integration of sensing, processing, and memory within a massively parallel computing architecture leads to an interesting trade-off between high performance, low latency, low power, low cost, and versatility in a machine vision system. Here, we review the history of image sensing and processing hardware from the perspective of in-pixel computing and outline the key features of a state-of-the-art smart camera system based on a PPA device, through the description of the SCAMP-5 system. We describe several robotic applications for agile ground and aerial vehicles, demonstrating PPA sensing functionalities including high-speed odometry, target tracking, obstacle detection, and avoidance. In the conclusions, we provide some insight and perspective on the future development of PPA devices, including their application and benefits within agile, robust, adaptable, and lightweight robotics.",2022,,SCIENCE ROBOTICS,7,67,,WOS:000832768700004,10.1126/scirobotics.abl7755,,#11681,Dudek 2022,,
Differential Gravity Induced Absorption Changes in Coleoptiles of <i>Zea mays</i> as measured with the Single Wavelength Space Discriminator (SWSD),"Schmidt, Werner","Various spectroscopic experiments performed on the AIRBUS ZERO G in the years 2002 to 2011 clearly exhibited optical reflection/absorption changes as a result of gravitational changes (GIACs) in Arabidopsis, Phycomyces sporangiophores, avena or maize coleoptiles. Minute absorption/ reflection changes (Delta GIAC) between the upper and lower site of horizontally placed maize coleoptiles were detected at the gravisensing tip during flight parabolas in response to hyper- and microgravity. For this purpose we had developed a Single Wavelength Space Discriminator (SWSD) as based on the former Micro Dual Wavelength Spectrophotometer (MDWS). The SWSD allows to tilt and rotate the coleoptile and the sensing light fiber tips independently in all directions. Thus we were able to discriminate between asymmetrical/vertical, i.e. sensitive, and symmetrical/ horizontal, i.e. non-sensitive arrangement of the light fiber tips.",2012,,MICROGRAVITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,24,2,103-112,WOS:000303864600004,10.1007/s12217-012-9299-4,,#15788,Schmidt 2012,,
Experimental demonstration of weak-light inter-spacecraft clock jitter readout for TianQin.,"Zeng, Hanyu; Yan, Hao; Xie, Siyuan; Jiang, Sicheng; Li, Yingzi; Pan, Yuhang; He, Diaomin; Du, Yuanbo; Yeh, Hsien-Chi","The space-based gravitational wave detection mission, TianQin, requires high-level synchronization between independent clocks of all spacecrafts to extract the gravitational wave signals. It is necessary to measure the inter-spacecraft relative clock jitter based on laser phase-sideband clock transfer. The main challenge is the tracking and locking of clock sideband beatnote signals with low signal-to-noise ratio and frequency variation. In this paper, a systematic scheme of inter-spacecraft clock jitter readout is reported. The requirement of the clock transfer link for TianQin based on the time-delay interferometry algorithm is derived. A bi-directional laser interferometer system with a transmission optical power below 1 nW and a time delay of ~50 micros is built up to demonstrate the weak-light clock transfer. In this scheme, frequency modulation is performed on the laser to simulate the inter-spacecraft Doppler frequency shift and its variation. Based on electrical and optical clock transfer comparison experiments, it is demonstrated that the GHz frequency synthesizer is the main noise source below the 50 mHz frequency range. The residual clock jitter noise introduced by the optical transfer link is below 40 fs/Hz1/2 above the 6 mHz frequency range, and the fractional frequency instability is less than 6.7 x 10-17 at 1000 s, which meets the requirement of the TianQin mission. Ultimately, The carrier phase measurement accuracy reaches 1 x 10-4 cycles/Hz1/2 above 6 mHz after differential clock noise correction using measured clock jitter.",2023,/,Optics express,31,21,34648-34666,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.503164,37859216,#67,Zeng 2023,,
The solar UV environment and bacterial spore UV resistance: considerations for Earth-to-Mars transport by natural processes and human spaceflight.,"Nicholson, Wayne L; Schuerger, Andrew C; Setlow, Peter","The environment in space and on planets such as Mars can be lethal to microorganisms because of the high vacuum and high solar radiation flux, in particular UV radiation, in such environments. Spores of various Bacillus species are among the organisms most resistant to the lethal effects of high vacuum and UV radiation, and as a consequence are of major concern for planetary contamination via unmanned spacecraft or even natural processes. This review focuses on the spores of various Bacillus species: (i) their mechanisms of UV resistance; (ii) their survival in unmanned spacecraft, space flight and simulated space flight and Martian conditions; (iii) the UV flux in space and on Mars; (iv) factors affecting spore survival in such high UV flux environments.",2005,/,Mutation research,571,2-Jan,249-64,,,15748651,#3276,Nicholson 2005,,Animal
Continuous Online Adaptation of Bioinspired Adaptive Neuroendocrine Control for Autonomous Walking Robots,"Homchanthanakul, Jettanan; Manoonpong, Poramate","Walking animals can continuously adapt their locomotion to deal with unpredictable changing environments. They can also take proactive steps to avoid colliding with an obstacle. In this study, we aim to realize such features for autonomous walking robots so that they can efficiently traverse complex terrains. To achieve this, we propose novel bioinspired adaptive neuroendocrine control. In contrast to conventional locomotion control methods, this approach does not require robot and environmental models, exteroceptive feedback, or multiple learning trials. It integrates three main modular neural mechanisms, relying only on proprioceptive feedback and short-term memory, namely: 1) neural central pattern generator (CPG)-based control; 2) an artificial hormone network (AHN); and 3) unsupervised input correlation-based learning (ICO). The neural CPG-based control creates insect-like gaits, while the AHN can continuously adapt robot joint movement individually with respect to the terrain during the stance phase using only the torque feedback. In parallel, the ICO generates short-term memory for proactive obstacle negotiation during the swing phase, allowing the posterior legs to step over the obstacle before hitting it. The control approach is evaluated on a bioinspired hexapod robot walking on complex unpredictable terrains (e.g., gravel, grass, and extreme random stepfield). The results show that the robot can successfully perform energy-efficient autonomous locomotion and online continuous adaptation with proactivity to overcome such terrains. Since our adaptive neural control approach does not require a robot model, it is general and can be applied to other bioinspired walking robots to achieve a similar adaptive, autonomous, and versatile function.",2022,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS,33,5,1833-1845,WOS:000732324600001,10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3119127,,#11622,Homchanthanakul 2022,,
Adaptive sensing scheme using naive Bayes classification for environment monitoring with drone,"Ho, Yao-Hua; Huang, Yu-Te; Chu, Hao-Hua; Chen, Ling-Jyh","Environmental sensors are important for collecting data to understand environmental changes and analyze environmental issues. In order to effectively monitor environmental changes, high-density sensor deployment and evenly distributed spatial distance between sensors become the requirements and desired properties for such applications. In many applications, sensors are deployed in locations that are difficult and dangerous to reach (e.g. mountaintop or skyscraper roof). To collect data from those sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles are used to act as data mules to overcome the problem of collecting data in challenging environments. In this article, we extend the adaptive return-to-home sensing algorithm with a parameter-tuning algorithm that combines naive Bayes classification and binary search to adapt adaptive return-to-home sensing parameters effectively on the fly. The proposed approach is able to (1) optimize number of sensing attempts, (2) reduce oscillation of the distance for consecutive attempts, and (3) reserve enough power for drone to return-to-home. Our results show that the naive Bayes classification-enhanced adaptive return-to-home sensing scheme is able to avoid oscillation in sensing and guarantees return-to-home feature while behaving more cost-effective in parameter tuning than the other machine learning-based approaches.",2018,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS,14,1,,WOS:000423802100001,10.1177/1550147718756036,,#12510,Ho 2018,,
Coculture of meniscus cells and mesenchymal stem cells in simulated microgravity.,"Weiss, William M; Mulet-Sierra, Aillette; Kunze, Melanie; Jomha, Nadr M; Adesida, Adetola B","Simulated microgravity has been shown to enhance cartilaginous matrix formation by chondrocytes and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Similarly, coculture of primary chondrocytes with MSCs has been shown as a strategy to simultaneously retain the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes and enhance cartilaginous matrix formation. In this study, we investigated the effect of simulated microgravity on cocultures of primary human meniscus cells and adipose-derived MSCs. We used biochemical, qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays to conduct our investigation. Simulated microgravity significantly enhanced cartilaginous matrix formation in cocultures of primary meniscus cells and adipose-derived MSCs.

Cell migration guided by long-lived spatial memory.,"d'Alessandro, Joseph; Barbier-Chebbah, Alex; Cellerin, Victor; Benichou, Olivier; Mege, Rene Marc; Voituriez, Raphael; Ladoux, Benoit","Living cells actively migrate in their environment to perform key biological functions-from unicellular organisms looking for food to single cells such as fibroblasts, leukocytes or cancer cells that can shape, patrol or invade tissues. Cell migration results from complex intracellular processes that enable cell self-propulsion, and has been shown to also integrate various chemical or physical extracellular signals. While it is established that cells can modify their environment by depositing biochemical signals or mechanically remodelling the extracellular matrix, the impact of such self-induced environmental perturbations on cell trajectories at various scales remains unexplored. Here, we show that cells can retrieve their path: by confining motile cells on 1D and 2D micropatterned surfaces, we demonstrate that they leave long-lived physicochemical footprints along their way, which determine their future path. On this basis, we argue that cell trajectories belong to the general class of self-interacting random walks, and show that self-interactions can rule large scale exploration by inducing long-lived ageing, subdiffusion and anomalous first-passage statistics. Altogether, our joint experimental and theoretical approach points to a generic coupling between motile cells and their environment, which endows cells with a spatial memory of their path and can dramatically change their space exploration.",2021,/,Nature communications,12,1,4118,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24249-8,34226542,#977,d'Alessandro 2021,,
